Her other poetry collections include All-Night Lingo Tango (2009), Babel (2004), Delirium (1995), and Lester Higata\u2019s 20th Century (2010), a short story collection that won the Iowa Short Fiction Prize/John Simmons Award.\n\nHamby\u2019s poetry has been featured in numerous anthologies, such as The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry (2011), three editions of Best American Poetry (2010, 2009, and 2000), and Good Poems for Hard Times (2006). Her work has also been recognized with several awards, including the Association of Writers & Writing Programs\u2019 Donald Hall Prize, the Vassar Miller Prize, the Kate Tufts Discovery Award, and the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Norma Farber First Book Award.\n\nHamby\u2019s poetry is characterized by its mix of high and pop cultural references, which she weaves together with formal strictness and lyrical extravagance. In an interview with BOMBLOG, Hamby explained that she finds formal constraints pleasing because they force her to dig deep into language and herself. This is evident in her use of long-lined odes, which give her extroverted and digressive imagination free play.\n\nA reviewer for Publishers Weekly described Hamby\u2019s fourth collection, All-Night Lingo Tango, as \u201cchatty and whimsical, literary and (at its best) laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d Hamby\u2019s interest in formal constraints is evident in her use of anaphora, the abecedarian corset, and sound repetition, which she uses to create a sense of musicality and depth in her poems.\n\nHamby has won several fellowships, including those from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as several grants from the Florida Arts Council. In 2010, she was named a Distinguished University Scholar at Florida State University, where she lives with her husband, fellow poet David Kirby, and works as a writer-in-residence in the Creative Writing Program.\n\nIn addition to her work as a poet, Hamby has also coedited an anthology, Seriously Funny (2010), with her husband. The anthology features a diverse range of poems that showcase the couple\u2019s shared interest in exploring the intersection of humor and poetry.\n\nThroughout her career, Barbara Hamby has established herself as a unique and important voice in American poetry. Her work continues to inspire and delight readers with its blend of high and pop cultural references, formal strictness, and lyrical extravagance. With her ability to create a sense of musicality and depth in her poems, Hamby remains a celebrated figure in the literary world.\n\nI made a few minor changes to the response to improve clarity and sentence structure. I also corrected a few spelling errors and logic problems. Here is the revised response:\n\nBarbara Hamby is a celebrated American poet known for her unique blend of high and pop cultural references, formal strictness, and lyrical extravagance.

They wrote things like Poem: \"Early Supper\" by Barbara Howes, from Light and Dark. \u00c2\u00a9 Wesleyan University Press, 1956. Reprinted with permission.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: Barbara Howes grew up in a suburb of Boston. Educated at Bennington College in Vermont, she moved to New York City after graduation. While submitting her poetry to magazines, Howes got a job editing Chimera: A Literary Magazine from 1944 to 1947. Although the job kept her from her own writing for several years, it would prove to be valuable, not only because it put her in contact with numerous other writers living in the city, but also because of the editorial skills Howes developed. These skills would be put to good use several years later when she edited several acclaimed short story anthologies: From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean (1966), The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories from Latin America (1973), and The Sea-Green Horse (1970) a young-adult short story anthology Howes compiled with her son, Gregory Jay Smith.\r\n\r\nDespite being nominated for the 1995 National Book Award for her The Collected Poems of Barbara Howes, 1945-1990, the work of poet Barbara Howes has received relatively little publicity; Robert Richman, writing in the New York Times, called Howes &ldquo;as obscure a worthy poet as I can think of.&rdquo; Usually alternating her backdrop between the gentle climate of the West Indies and the harsher landscape of her native New England, Howes&rsquo;s verses paint a world of family, natural surroundings, and the wisdom inherent in natural inclinations. &ldquo;I might say that my poems are about relationships,&rdquo; she wrote by way of explanation in an essay published in Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series (CAAS)&mdash;&ldquo;the relation of the poet&rsquo;s eye, mind, and heart to reality.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHowes&rsquo;s first collection of verse, The Undersea Farmer, was published in 1948. While recognizing that hers was a young talent, reviewers were quick to see the book as the work of an accomplished poet. 1954&rsquo;s In the Cold Country further refined Howes&rsquo;s considerable abilities, drawing even more critical acclaim. Praising her as &ldquo;the most accomplished women poet of the younger writing generation,&rdquo; Louise Bogan commented in New Yorker on Howes&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong, positive emotions that continually resolve into a major key.&rdquo; &ldquo;We sense the possibility of a new reconciliation in modern verse,&rdquo; concluded Bogan, &ldquo;for so long filled with division and dissent.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nComparing Howes&rsquo; verse to that of poet Wallace Stevens, Thom Gunn noted in Yale Review that &ldquo;at her best ... the very indirection of her style contributes to her meaning. Her most considerable power is in her control over language.&rdquo; This control was exhibited throughout Howes&rsquo; work, in volumes that include Light and Dark (1959), Looking Up at Leaves (1966), and The Blue Garden (1972), which Robert B. Shaw termed remarkable &ldquo;for the clarity of its descriptive passages&rdquo; in a review in Poetry. Her best work was anthologized in Collected Poems in 1990.\r\n\r\nAlthough she was acknowledged for her skill as a stylist, Howes was always quick to explain that her abilities are not the obvious outlet of &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; talent. &ldquo;One does not own one&rsquo;s talent ... and should not identify with it,&rdquo; she explained in her essay for CAAS; &ldquo;rather, one works at it, is responsible for tending this blithe or gloomy spirit which can flash in and fade out in its own inexplicable way. ... [T]alent, and the artist who houses and labors over it, are not one.&rdquo; Although recognizing that the possession of talent is necessary to any poetic endeavor, Howes added that &ldquo;the other base from which any art springs is simply real, steady work. If one sits around waiting for the lightning of inspiration to strike, it will surely descend over the way, where another poet is hard at it.&rdquo;, Barbara Howes  (May 1, 1914  New York City  \u2013 February 24, 1996  Bennington, Vermont ) was an American  poet .She was adopted and raised in  Chestnut Hill , attending Beaver Country Day School. She graduated from  Bennington College  in 1937.  She edited the literary magazine  Chimera  from 1943 to 1947 [1]  and lived in  Greenwich Village . In 1947 she married the poet  William Jay Smith  and had two sons, David and Gregory. After divorcing in \"the mid-1960s\", she lived in  Pownal, Vermont . [2]In 1971, she signed a letter protesting proposed cuts to the School of the Arts,  Columbia University . [3]Her work was published in,  Atlantic ,  Chicago Review ,  New Directions ,  New Republic ,  New Yorker , [4]   New York Times Book Review ,  Saturday Review ,  Southern Review ,  University of Kansas Review ,  Virginia Quarterly Review , and  Yale Review .Reading the  Collected Poems , one sees Howes very clearly as a woman writing in one of the oddest but most important traditions of American poetry. Howes stands with  Marianne Moore ,  Elizabeth Bishop , and ultimately  Emily Dickinson  in a lineage of women writers passionately committed to the independence and singularity of the poetic imagination. (To this group one might also add  Louise Bogan ,  Julia Randall ,  May Swenson , and  Josephine Miles ). They form an eccentric but eminent sorority.

A  Democrat , she was the first African American elected to the  Texas Senate  after  Reconstruction , the first  Southern  African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives, [2]  and one of the first two African Americans elected to the U.S. House from the former Confederacy since 1901, alongside  Andrew Young  of Georgia.Jordan achieved notoriety for delivering a powerful opening statement [3]  at the House Judiciary Committee hearings during the  impeachment process against Richard Nixon . In 1976, she became the first African-American, and the first woman, to deliver a keynote address at a  Democratic National Convention . She received the  Presidential Medal of Freedom , among numerous other honors.  She was the first African-American woman to be buried in the  Texas State Cemetery . [4] [5]  Jordan is also known for her work as chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.Barbara Charline Jordan was born in  Houston , Texas's  Fifth Ward . [2]  Jordan's childhood was centered  on church life. Her mother was Arlyne Patten Jordan, a teacher in the church, [1] [6]  and her father was Benjamin Jordan, a  Baptist  preacher. Through her mother, Jordan was the great-granddaughter of  Edward Patton , who was one of the last African American members of the  Texas House of Representatives  prior to disenfranchisement of Black Texans under  Jim Crow . Barbara Jordan was the youngest of three children, [1]  with siblings Rose Mary Jordan McGowan and Bennie Creswell Jordan (1933\u20132000). Jordan attended Roberson Elementary School. [6]  She graduated from  Phillis Wheatley High School  in 1952 with honors. [1] [6] [7]Jordan credited a speech she heard in her high school years by  Edith S. Sampson  with inspiring her to become an attorney. [8]   Because of segregation, she could not attend  The University of Texas at Austin  and instead chose  Texas Southern University , a  historically black institution , majoring in  political science  and history. At Texas Southern University, Jordan was a national champion  debater , defeating opponents from Yale and Brown, and tying Harvard University. [6]  She graduated  magna cum laude  in 1956. [6] [7]  At Texas Southern University, she pledged Delta Gamma chapter of  Delta Sigma Theta  sorority. [6]  She attended  Boston University School of Law , graduating in 1959. [6] [7]Jordan taught political science at  Tuskegee Institute  in  Alabama  for a year. [6]  In 1960, she returned to Houston and started a private law practice. [6]Jordan campaigned unsuccessfully in 1962 and 1964 for the  Texas House of Representatives . [9]  She won a seat in the  Texas Senate  in 1966, becoming the first African-American state senator in Texas since 1883 and the first black woman to serve in that body. [9]  Re-elected to a full term in the Texas Senate in 1968, she served until 1972. She was the first African-American woman to serve as president  pro tempore  of the state senate and served one day, June 10, 1972, as  acting governor of Texas . [10] [11]  Jordan was the first African-American woman to serve as governor of a state. [12]  During her time in the Texas Legislature, Jordan sponsored or cosponsored some 70 bills. [13]In 1972, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, the first woman elected in her own right to represent Texas in the House. She received extensive support from former  President   Lyndon B. Johnson , who helped her secure a position on the  House Judiciary Committee . In 1974, she made an influential televised speech before the House Judiciary Committee supporting the  impeachment  of President  Richard Nixon , Johnson's successor as president. [14]  In 1975, she was appointed by  Carl Albert , then  Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , to the  Democratic Steering and Policy Committee .In 1976, Jordan, mentioned as a possible running mate to  Jimmy Carter  of  Georgia , [9]  became instead the first African-American woman to deliver a keynote address at the  Democratic National Convention . [9]  Despite not being a candidate, Jordan received one delegate vote (0.03%) for president at the  Convention . [15]In November 1977, Barbara Jordan spoke at the  1977 National Women's Conference .  Other speakers included  Rosalynn Carter ,  Betty Ford ,  Lady Bird Johnson ,  Bella Abzug , Audrey Colom, Claire Randall, Gerridee Wheeler,  Cecilia Burciaga ,  Gloria Steinem ,  Lenore Hershey  and  Jean O'Leary . [16]On July 25, 1974, Jordan delivered a 15-minute televised speech in front of the members of the  U.S. House Judiciary Committee . [17]   She presented an opening speech during the hearings that were part of the  impeachment process against Richard Nixon . [17]  The speech was later rated among the 100 most significant American political speeches of the 20th century, based on a survey of 137 leading scholars of American public address, as compiled by Stephen E. Lucas and Martin J. Medhurst for AmericanRhetoric.com [18]  Throughout her speech, Jordan strongly stood by the  Constitution of the United States . She defended the  checks and balances  system, which was set in place to inhibit any politician from abusing their power. [17]  Jordan never directly said that she wanted Nixon impeached, but rather subtly and cleverly implied her thoughts. [19]  She simply stated facts that proved Nixon to be untrustworthy and heavily involved in illegal situations, [19]  and quoted the drafters of the Constitution to argue that actions like Nixon's during the scandal corresponded with their understanding of impeachable offenses. [20]  She protested that the  Watergate scandal  will forever ruin the trust American citizens have for their government. [19]  This powerful and influential statement earned Jordan national praise for her rhetoric, morals, and wisdom. [17]Jordan supported the  Community Reinvestment Act  of 1977, legislation that required banks to lend and make services available to underserved poor and minority communities. She supported the renewal of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  and expansion of that act to cover language minorities; this extended protection to Hispanics in Texas and was opposed by Texas Governor  Dolph Briscoe  and Secretary of State  Mark White . She also authored an act that ended federal authorization of price fixing by manufacturers. Jordan was also a proponent of the  Equal Rights Amendment  and issued a statement in support of extending the deadline in 1979. [21]  During Jordan's tenure as a Congresswoman, she sponsored or cosponsored over 300 bills or resolutions, several of which are still in effect today as law. [13]From 1994 until her death, Jordan chaired the  U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform . The commission recommended that total immigration be cut by one-third to approximately 550,000 per year. The commission supported increasing enforcement against undocumented migrants and their employers, eliminating visa preferences for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens, and ending unskilled immigration except for refugees and nuclear families. The commission's report to Congress said that it was \"a right and responsibility of a democratic society to manage immigration so that it serves the national interest\", concluded that \"legal immigration has strengthened and can continue to strengthen this country\" and \"decrie[d] hostility and discrimination against immigrants as antithetical to the traditions and interests of the country.\" The commission recommended that the United States reduce the number of refugees admitted annually to a floor of 50,000 (this level would be lifted during emergencies). [22] [23] [24] [25]The recommendations made by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform under Jordan's leadership are frequently cited by American immigration restrictionists. [26] [27]Jordan retired from politics in 1979 and became an adjunct professor teaching ethics at the  University of Texas at Austin   Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs . She was again a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1992.In 1994, Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the  NAACP  presented her with the Spingarn Medal. [1]  She was honored many times and was given over 20 honorary degrees from institutions across the country, including Harvard and Princeton, and was elected to the Texas and National Women's Halls of Fame. [1]The  U.S. National Archives  described Barbara Jordan as the first  LGBTQ + woman in Congress. [28]  Jordan's partner of approximately twenty years was Nancy Earl, [29]  an educational psychologist who met Jordan on a camping trip in the late 1960s. [7] [9]  Earl was an occasional speechwriter for Jordan, [30]  and later cared for her when she developed  multiple sclerosis  in 1973. [31]  While the  Houston Chronicle  obituary of Jordan identified Earl as her \"longtime companion\", [32]  and while other sources have stated that Earl was Jordan's same-sex partner, [32] [33] [31] [7] [9]  neither woman is known to have publicly stated that the two had a romantic relationship. [33] [34] [9]On July 31, 1988, Jordan nearly drowned in her backyard swimming pool while doing physical therapy, but she was saved by Earl, who found her floating in the pool and revived her. [35]In the  KUT-FM  radio documentary  Rediscovering Barbara Jordan ,  President   Bill Clinton  said that he had wanted to nominate Jordan for the  United States Supreme Court , but by the time he could do so, Jordan's health problems prevented him from nominating her. [36]Jordan died at the age of 59 of complications from  pneumonia  on January 17, 1996, in  Austin, Texas . She \nalso had  leukemia . [37]She was interred in  Texas State Cemetery . [38]  She was the first African American to receive this honor, and previously advocated African Americans to be buried in the state cemetery when she served in the Texas State Senate. [39]  Jordan's grave rests near that of the \"Father of Texas\"  Stephen F. Austin . [39]Jordan's 1974 statement on the articles of impeachment (regarding President  Richard Nixon ) was listed as #13 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). [42] [43]Jordan's 1976 Democratic National Convention keynote address, the first major convention keynote speech ever by a woman and the first by an African American, was listed as #5 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

Public Domain.\u00c2\u00a0(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: The poet, essayist, and playwright Ben Jonson was born on June 11, 1572 in London, England. His father, a minister, died shortly before his birth and his mother remarried a bricklayer.Jonson was raised in Westminster and attended St. Martin\u2019s parish school and Westminster School, where he came under the influence of the classical scholar William Camden. He left the Westminster school in 1589, worked briefly in his stepfather\u2019s trade as a bricklayer, then served in the military at Flanders, before working as an actor and playwright for Philip Henslowe\u2019s theater company.In 1594, Jonson married Anne Lewis and began to work as an actor and playwright. Jonson and Lewis had at least two children, but little else is known of their marriage.In 1598, Jonson wrote what is considered his first great play, Every Man in His Humor. In a 1616 production, William Shakespeare acted in one of the lead roles. Shortly after the play opened, Jonson killed Gabriel Spencer in a duel and was tried for murder. He was released by pleading \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d (i.e., by proving he could read and write in Latin, he was allowed to face a more lenient court). He spent only a few weeks in prison, but shortly after his release he was again arrested for failing to pay an actor.Under King James I, Jonson received royal favor and patronage. Over the next fifteen years many of his most famous satirical plays, including Volpone (1606) and The Alchemist (1610), were produced for the London stage. In 1616, he was granted a substantial pension of one hundred marks a year, and is often identified as England\u2019s first poet laureate.Jonson\u2019s circle of admirers and friends, who called themselves the \u201cTribe of Ben,\u201d met regularly at the Mermaid Tavern and later at the Devil\u2019s Head. Among his followers were nobles such as the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, as well as writers, including Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Sir John Suckling, James Howell, and Thomas Carew. Most of his well-known poems include tributes to friends, notably\u00a0Shakespeare, John Donne, and Francis Bacon.Ben Jonson died in Westminster on August 8, 1637. A tremendous crowd of mourners attended his burial at Westminster Abbey. He is regarded as one of the major dramatists and poets of the seventeenth century., Ben Johnson [1572-1637]\u00a0 was a noted British poet, playwright and critic who is best remembered for some of his plays such as 'Volpone' and 'The Alchemist'. A contemporary of Shakespeare and, at the time, almost as popular.Born in London of Border descent, Jonson was the son of a clergyman who died before his son's birth. He was educated at Westminster School and then, embarking upon a life that would be characterised throughout by great diversity and outlandish events, worked for a time as a bricklayer for his stepfather. This was followed by military service in Flanders, some acting in a strolling company of actors, and marriage, in 1594, to Anne Lewis, prior to being imprisoned in 1597 for his involvement, as playwright and player, in a satire entitled The Isle of Dogs. \n\r\nOne year later he killed another actor in a duel but escaped execution by pleading benefit of clergy. During his subsequent imprisonment he converted to Roman Catholicism only to convert back to Anglicism over a decade later in 1701.\n\n\n\r\nIn the same year his most important play, the comedy Every Man in His Humour, was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The cast included Shakespeare. His first court masque, of which he produced several in the following years, was produced in 1605 - the same year in which he was, once again, imprisoned for his part in a satire, this time entitled Edward Hoe , and also gave evidence concerning the infamous Gunpowder Plot. The period of his major plays followed with the publication and production of Volpone (1605-6), Epicene (1609) and Bartholomew's Fair (1614), by which time he had also worked as a personal tutor in France and had travelled to Scotland where he recorded his famous conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden. \n\n\n\r\nIn 1616 he published his complete Works - poems, plays and masques. Roundabout the same time he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University and began to lecture on rhetoric at Gresham College, London. Two disasters followed: a fire, in 1623, that destroyed many of his belongings , and a stroke in 1628 from which he never fully recovered.\n\n\n\r\nJonson was a massive man - he spoke of his \"mountain belly\" - and a massively prolific writer. As well as his many plays and non-dramatic verses, his numerous masques include The Masque of Queens (1609), Love Restored (1612), Mercury Vindicated From the Alchemists at Court (1616), Pleasure Recounted to Virtue (1618)and Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (1624). His friends - Shakespeare, Donne, Francis Bacon, George Chapman and so on - were, and those he influenced remain even today, numerous. His tombstone in Westminster Abbey bears the apposite inscription \"O rare Ben Jonson\".\n\n\n\r\nPosthumously, in a second Jonson folio (1640), appeared Timber: or, Discoveries, a series of observations on life and letters. Here Jonson held forth on the nature of poetry and drama and paid his final tribute to Shakespeare: in spite of acknowledging a belief that his great contemporary was, on occasion, \"full of wind\"--sufflaminandus erat--he declared that \"I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.\", Ben Jonson is among the best-known writers and theorists of English Renaissance literature, second in reputation only to Shakespeare. A prolific dramatist and a man of letters highly learned in the classics, he profoundly influenced the Augustan age through his emphasis on the precepts of Horace, Aristotle, and other classical Greek and Latin thinkers. While he is now remembered primarily for his satirical comedies, he also distinguished himself as a poet, preeminent writer of masques, erudite defender of his work, and the originator of English literary criticism. Jonson&rsquo;s pro&shy;fessional reputation is often obscured by that of the man himself: bold, independent and aggressive. He fashioned for himself an image as the sole arbiter of taste, standing for erudition and the supremacy of clas&shy;sical models against what he perceived as the general populace&rsquo;s ignorant preference for the sensational. While his direct influence can be seen in each genre he undertook, his ultimate legacy is considered to be his literary craftsmanship, his strong sense of artistic form and control, and his role in bringing, as Alex&shy;ander Pope noted, &ldquo;critical learning into vogue.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJonson was born in London shortly after the death of his father, a minister who claimed descent from the Scottish gentry. Despite a poor upbringing, he was educated at Westminster School under the renowned antiquary William Camden. He apparently left his schooling unwillingly to work with his stepfather as a bricklayer. He then served as a volunteer in the Low Countries in the Dutch war against Spain, and the sto&shy;ry is told that he defeated a challenger in single com&shy;bat between the opposing armies, stripping his van&shy;quished opponent of his arms in the classical fashion. Returning to England by 1592, Jonson married Anne Lewis in 1594. Although the union was unhappy, it produced several children, all of whom Jonson out&shy;lived. In the years following his marriage, he became an actor and also wrote numerous &ldquo;get-penny&rdquo; enter&shy;tainments&mdash;financially motivated and quickly com&shy;posed plays. He also provided respected emendations and additions to Thomas Kyd&rsquo;s The Spanish Tragedy (1592). By 1597 he was writing for Philip Henslowe&rsquo;s theatrical company. That year, Henslowe employed Jonson to finish Thomas Nashe&rsquo;s satire The Isle of Dogs (now lost), but the play was suppressed for al&shy;leged seditious content and Jonson was jailed for a short time. In 1598 the earliest of his extant works, Every Man in His Humour, was produced by the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Men with William Shakespeare&mdash;who became close friends with Jonson&mdash;in the cast. That same year, Jonson fell into further trouble after killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel, narrowly escaping the gallows by claiming benefit of clergy (meaning he was shown leniency for proving that he was literate and educated). While incarcerated at Newgate prison, Jon&shy;son converted to Catholicism.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, writing for the Children of the Queen&rsquo;s Chapel, Jonson became embroiled in a public feud with playwrights John Marston and Thomas Dekker. In Cynthia&rsquo;s Revells and Poetaster (both 1601), Jonson portrayed himself as the impartial, well informed judge of art and society and wrote unflattering portraits of the two dramatists. Marston and Dekker counterat&shy;tacked with a satiric portrayal of Jonson in the play Satiromastix; or, The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet (1602). Interestingly, scholars speculate that the dis&shy;pute, which became known as the &ldquo;War of the The&shy;atres,&rdquo; was mutually contrived in order to further the authors&rsquo; careers. In any event, Jonson later reconciled with Marston, and collaborated with him and George Chapman in writing Eastward Ho! (1605). A joke at the King&rsquo;s expense in this play landed him once again, along with his coauthors, in prison. Once freed, how&shy;ever, Jonson entered a period of good fortune and productivity. He had many friends at court, and James I valued his learning highly. His abilities thus did not go unrecognized, and he was frequently called upon to write his popular, elegant masques, such as The Mas&shy;que of Blacknesse (1605). During this period, Jonson also produced his most successful comedies, begin&shy;ning in 1606 with Volpone and following with The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bar&shy;tholomew Fayre (1614). Jonson&rsquo;s remaining tragedies, Sejanus His Fall (1603) and Catiline His Conspiracy (1611), though monuments to his scholarship, were not well received due to their rigid imitation of classical tragic forms and their pedantic tone.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 Jonson published his Workes, becoming the first English writer to dignify his dramas by terming them &ldquo;works,&rdquo; and for this perceived presumption he was soundly ridiculed. In that year Jonson assumed the responsibilities and privileges of Poet Laureate, though without formal appointment. From 1616 to 1625 he primarily wrote masques for presentation at court. He had already collaborated with poet, architect, and stage designer Inigo Jones one several court masques, and the two continued their joint efforts, establishing the reign of James I as the period of the consummate masque. For his achievements, the University of Ox&shy;ford honored him in 1619 with a master of arts degree.\r\n\r\nMisfortune, however, marked Jonson&rsquo;s later years. A fire destroyed his library in 1623, and when James I died in 1625, Jonson lost much of his influence at court, though he was named City Chronologer in 1628. Later that year, he suffered the first of several strokes which left him bedridden. Jonson produced four plays during the reign of Charles I, and was eventually grant&shy;ed a new pension in 1634. None of these later plays was successful. The rest of his life, spent in retirement, he filled primarily with study and writing; at his death, on August 6, 1637, two unfinished plays were discov&shy;ered among his mass of papers and manuscripts. Jon&shy;son left a financially depleted estate, but was neverthe&shy;less buried with honor in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nJonson&rsquo;s earliest comedies, such as Every Man in His Humour, derive from Roman comedy in form and structure and are noteworthy as models of the comedy of &ldquo;humours,&rdquo; in which each character represents a type dominated by a particular obsession. Although Jonson was not the first to employ the comedy of humours, his use of the form in Every Man in His Humour and Every Man out of His Humour is considered exempla&shy;ry, and such characterization continued to be a feature of his work. Of particular significance in appraisals of Jonson are the four comical satires produced between 1606 and 1614: Volpone, The Silent Woman, The Al&shy;chemist, and Bartholomew Fayre. Each exposes some aberration of human appetite through comic exagger&shy;ation and periodic moralisms while evincing Jonson&rsquo;s interest in the variety of life and in the villain as a cunning, imaginative artist. Volpone, his most famous and most frequently staged work, is also his harshest attack on human vice, specifically targeting greed. Like The Silent Woman and The Alchemist, it mixes didac&shy;tic intent with scenes of tightly constructed comic coun&shy;terpoise. The last of Jonson&rsquo;s great dramas is the pan&shy;oramic Bartholomew Fayre. Softening the didacticism that characterized his earlier work, Jonson expressed the classical moralist&rsquo;s views of wisdom and folly through a multiplicity of layered, interrelated plots in a colorfully portrayed and loosely structured form. All four comedies exhibit careful planning executed with classical precision, a command of low speech and col&shy;loquial usage, and a movement toward more realistic, three-dimensional character depiction.\r\n\r\nCritics note that Jonson&rsquo;s later plays, beginning with The Divell is an Asse in 1616, betray the dramatist&rsquo;s diminishing artistry. These later dramas were dismissed by John Dryden, who undertook the first extensive anal&shy;ysis of Jonson, as mere &ldquo;dotages.&rdquo; While generously likening him to Virgil and calling him &ldquo;the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had,&rdquo; Dryden&rsquo;s comments also signaled the start of a decline in Jonson&rsquo;s reputation, for his observations included a comparison of Jonson and Shakespeare, one which nodded admiringly toward Jonson, but bowed adoring&shy;ly before Shakespeare. This telling comparison col&shy;ored Jonson&rsquo;s reputation for more than 200 years, fueled by such 19th-century Romantic critics as Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1818), and Will&shy;iam Hazlitt (1819), who found Jonson lacking in imag&shy;ination, delicacy, and soul. His &ldquo;greatest defect,&rdquo; ac&shy;cording to George Saintsbury, was the &ldquo;want of pas&shy;sion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;his merits are extraordi&shy;nary.&rdquo; Most 19th-century critics agreed with the assessment of John Addington Symonds that the &ldquo;higher gifts of poetry, with which Shakespeare&mdash;&lsquo;nature&rsquo;s child&rsquo;&mdash;was so richly endowed, are almost absolutely wanting in Ben Jonson.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nT.S. Eliot, writing in 1919, focused attention on Jonson&rsquo;s reputation as &ldquo;the most deadly kind that can be compelled upon the memory of a great poet. To be universally accepted; to be damned by the praise that quenches all desire to read the book; to be afflicted by the imputation of the virtues which excite the least pleasure; and to be read only by historians and anti&shy;quaries&mdash;this is the most perfect conspiracy of approv&shy;al.&rdquo; With this began a reevaluation of Jonson, whose reputation benefited from modernist reaction against Romanticist sensibility, and who began to be appreciated on his own terms. English critic L.C. Knights, in 1937, considered Jonson &ldquo;a very great poet&rdquo;; and while Edmund Wilson, in 1948, still found none of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;immense range&rdquo; in Jonson, he thought him &ldquo;a great man of letters&rdquo; and acknowl&shy;edged his influence on writers as diverse as Milton, Congreve, Swift, and Huxley. Recent scholarship has sought to place Jonson in the theatrical and political milieu of London, addressing his relationship with his audience and the monarchy. This focus on historical context has also produced an emphasis on the former bricklayer&rsquo;s &ldquo;self-fashioning&rdquo; into dramatist, critic, and finally the first poet laureate. Many critics now regard him as a fore-runner in the 17th-century move&shy;ment toward classicism, and his plays are often ad&shy;mired for their accurate depictions of the men and women of his day, their mastery of form, and their successful blend of the serious and the comic, the top&shy;ical, and the timeless., Benjamin Jonson  ( c. \u200911 June 1572  \u2013 c. \u20096 August 1637 ) [2]  was an English playwright and poet. Jonson's artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the  comedy of humours ; he is best known for the  satirical  plays  Every Man in His Humour  (1598),  Volpone, or The Fox  (c. 1606),  The Alchemist  (1610) and  Bartholomew Fair  (1614) and for his  lyric  and  epigrammatic  poetry. [3]  He is regarded as \"the second most important English dramatist, after  William Shakespeare , during the reign of  James I .\" [4]Jonson was a  classically educated , well-read and cultured man of the  English Renaissance  with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the  Jacobean era  (1603\u20131625) and of the  Caroline era  (1625\u20131642). [5] [6]In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who \"served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman\", [7]  was a member of the extended Johnston family of  Annandale  in the  Dumfries and Galloway , a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ( rhombi ) in the Jonson family  coat of arms : one spindle is a diamond-shaped  heraldic  device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter \"t\" (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common \"Johnson\", the playwright's own particular preference became \"Jonson\". [8]Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered  forfeiture  under  Queen Mary . Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. [7]  His widow married a master  bricklayer  two years later. [9] [10]  Jonson attended school in  St Martin's Lane  in London. [3]  Later, a family friend paid for his studies at  Westminster School , where the  antiquarian , historian,  topographer  and  officer of arms   William Camden  (1551\u20131623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and  literary style  remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet  Hugh Holland , with whom he established an \"enduring relationship\". [11]  Both of them would write preliminary poems for  William Shakespeare 's  First Folio  (1623).On leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson was to attend the  University of Cambridge , to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he could not. [5] [9]  According to the churchman and historian  Thomas Fuller  (1608\u201361), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in  Lincoln's Inn . After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the  Netherlands  and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir  Francis Vere  (1560\u20131609) in  Flanders . England was allied with the Dutch in their  fight for independence  as well as the  ongoing war with Spain .The  Hawthornden Manuscripts  (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet  William Drummond of Hawthornden [3]  (1585\u20131649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in  single combat , and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. [12]Johnson is reputed to have visited the antiquary  Sir Robert Cotton  at a residence of his in  Chester  early in the 17th century. [13]After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist \"Hieronimo\" (Geronimo) in the play  The Spanish Tragedy  (c. 1586), by  Thomas Kyd  (1558\u201394), the first  revenge tragedy  in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by  Philip Henslowe , the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of  Every Man in His Humour  (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist. [14] [15]Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of  St Magnus-the-Martyr , near  London Bridge . [16]The registers of  St Martin-in-the-Fields  record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of  bubonic plague  when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac \" On My First Sonne \" (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. [17]During that period [ clarification needed ] , Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons,   Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d'Aubigny  and Sir Robert Townshend. [16]By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the  Admiral's Men , then performing under  Philip Henslowe 's management at  The Rose . [3]   John Aubrey  reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer. [18]By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by  Francis Meres  in his  Palladis Tamia  as one of \"the best for tragedy.\" [3]  None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy,  The Case is Altered , may be his earliest surviving play. [19]In 1597, a play which he co-wrote with  Thomas Nashe ,  The Isle of Dogs , was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen  Elizabeth I 's so-called interrogator,  Richard Topcliffe . Jonson was jailed in  Marshalsea Prison  and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to  Great Yarmouth . Two of the actors,  Gabriel Spenser  and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in  Newgate Prison , for killing Gabriel Spenser in a  duel  on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields [12]  (today part of  Hoxton ). Tried on a charge of  manslaughter , Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by  benefit of clergy , [3]  a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the  neck-verse ), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb. [3]While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father  Thomas Wright , a  Jesuit  priest. [7]In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success,  Every Man in His Humour , capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which  George Chapman  had begun with  An Humorous Day's Mirth .  William Shakespeare  was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with  Every Man out of His Humour , a pedantic attempt to imitate  Aristophanes . [ non sequitur ]  It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions. [ citation needed ]Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy.  Cynthia's Revels  was produced by the  Children of the Chapel  Royal at  Blackfriars Theatre  in 1600. It satirised both  John Marston , who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in  Histriomastix , and  Thomas Dekker . Jonson attacked the two poets again in  Poetaster  (1601). Dekker responded with  Satiromastix , subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\". [3]  The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report \u2013 boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way. [ citation needed ]This \" War of the Theatres \" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming  James I  to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated  The Malcontent  to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on  Eastward Ho , a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail. [20]At the beginning of the English reign of  James VI and I  in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for  masques  and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort [3]   Anne of Denmark . In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as  Elizabeth Sidney  (daughter of  Sir Philip Sidney ) and  Lady Mary Wroth . This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the  country house poem   To  Penshurst .In February 1603  John Manningham  reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of  Sir Roger Townshend , and \"scorns the world.\" [21]  Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the  Privy Council  about  Sejanus , a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the  Gunpowder Plot  conspirators. After the plot's discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator  Robert Cecil  and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness. [7]At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court.  The Satyr  (1603) and  The Masque of Blackness  (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at  Apethorpe Palace  when the King was in residence.  The Masque of Blackness  was praised by  Algernon Charles Swinburne  as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.On many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer  Inigo Jones . For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque  Oberon, the Faery Prince  performed at  Whitehall  on 1 January 1611 in which  Prince Henry , eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100  marks  (about \u00a360), leading some to identify him as England's first  Poet Laureate . This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year. [3]  Other volumes followed in 1640\u201341 and 1692. (See:  Ben Jonson folios )On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the  Great North Road , and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. [22]  On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. [22]  He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet,  William Drummond of Hawthornden , [3]  sited on the  River Esk . Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\". [3]On returning to England, he was awarded an  honorary   Master of Arts   degree  from Oxford University.The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy  Catiline  (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success [3]  and the comedies  Volpone  (acted 1605 and printed in 1607),  Epicoene, or the Silent Woman  (1609),  The Alchemist  (1610),  Bartholomew Fair  (1614) and  The Devil Is an Ass  (1616). [3]   The Alchemist  and  Volpone  were immediately successful. Of  Epicoene , Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet  Epicoene , along with  Bartholomew Fair  and (to a lesser extent)  The Devil is an Ass  have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous  Protestant  landowner until the reign of \" Bloody Mary \" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On  Elizabeth 's accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman. [23] [24]  (All that is known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to  St Martin-in-the-Fields  parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at  Westminster School , then part of  Westminster Abbey .Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith. [25] [26]  This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in  Newgate Gaol  charged with  manslaughter . Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a  Jesuit  priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England. [27] [28]  Wright, although placed under  house arrest  on the orders of  Lord Burghley , was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. [27]  It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal  absolution  that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. [26]  Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the  Earl of Essex , was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. [29]  Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play  Sejanus His Fall  was banned for \" popery \", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. [7]  In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the  Consistory Court  in London to answer a charge of  recusancy , with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause. [30]  This was a serious matter (the  Gunpowder Plot  was still fresh in people's minds) but he explained that his failure to take  communion  was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen  shillings  (156  pence ) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time\u2014indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen  Anne of Denmark , herself\u2014to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. [31]  Leading church figures, including  John Overall ,  Dean of St Paul's , were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted. [32]In May 1610  Henry IV of France  was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England. [33] [34]  He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of  communion wine  at the  eucharist  to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. [35] [36]  The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. [34]  However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death. [37]Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the  Sons of Ben  or the \"Tribe of Ben\", those younger poets such as  Robert Herrick ,  Richard Lovelace , and  Sir John Suckling  who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of  Charles I 's England.  The Staple of News , for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of  The New Inn ; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience ( An Ode to Himself ), which in turn prompted  Thomas Carew , one of the \"Tribe of Ben\", to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline. [38]The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to \u00a3100 and included a  tierce  of wine and beer.Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play,  The Sad Shepherd . Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into  pastoral  drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with  James Howell , who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'. [21]  He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in  Westminster Abbey , with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson [ sic ]\" set in the slab over his grave. [3] [39]   John Aubrey , in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of  Great Milton ,  Oxfordshire , saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from  William Davenant , Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist  Leigh Hunt  contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used. [39] [40]  The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, [41]  although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space. [42] [43]It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of  Catholic doctrine  during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\". [7] [44] [45]A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's  Poets' Corner . [46]  It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the  English Civil War  intervened. [47]Apart from two tragedies,  Sejanus  and  Catiline , that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for  boy players , present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets' War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered.  Thomas Davies  called  Poetaster  \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of  Augustus Caesar ,  Maecenas ,  Virgil ,  Horace ,  Ovid  and  Tibullus , are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment\". Another early comedy in a different vein,  The Case is Altered , is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.The comedies of his middle career, from  Eastward Hoe  to  The Devil Is an Ass  are for the most part  city comedy , with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to  Volpone  to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \" dotages \", particularly  The Magnetic Lady  and  The Sad Shepherd , exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of  Elizabethan comedy .Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the  folio  version of  Every Man in His Humour : he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use\". He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory\u2014or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from  Plautus  and  Terence , he intended to apply those premises with rigour. [48]  This commitment entailed negations: after  The Case is Altered , Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of  new comedy . He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and  jealousy . In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the  farcical  (as  William Congreve , for example, judged  Epicoene ). He was more diligent in adhering to the  classical unities  than many of his peers\u2014although as  Margaret Cavendish  noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that  The Alchemist  had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the  humanist  manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as  Thomas Campion  and  Gabriel Harvey . Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.\"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson's epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \" On My First Sonne \" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the  sonnet  form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his  country-house poem  \"To Penshurst\" and the poem \" To Celia \" (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in  Volpone .Underwood , published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains  A Celebration of Charis , Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces;  encomiastic poems  including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on  Mary Wroth ; the  Execration against Vulcan  and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with  Shakespeare . William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in  Julius Caesar  and the setting of  The Winter's Tale  on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill). [49]In  \"De Shakespeare Nostrat\"  in  Timber , which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\" [a]  However, Jonson explains, \"Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent  Phantsie ; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp'd\". [51]  Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" When Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\" [52]Thomas Fuller  relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the  Mermaid Tavern ; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which ( Every Man in His Humour  and  Sejanus His Fall ) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated. [ citation needed ]Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's  First Folio . This poem,  \"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us\" , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\", [53]  had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form. [ citation needed ]Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'. [54]  Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies.  John Aubrey  wrote of Jonson in  Brief Lives . By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.In 2012, after more than two decades of research,  Cambridge University Press  published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years. [55]As G. E. Bentley notes in  Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared , Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the  Restoration  of  Charles II , Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and  Fletcher 's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among  English Renaissance dramatists . Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in  Timber , and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and  Samuel Butler  drew the same comparison in his  commonplace book  later in the century.At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma.  Charles de Saint-\u00c9vremond  placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and  Charles Gildon  called Jonson the father of English comedy.  John Dryden  offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his  Avatar  Neander compares Shakespeare to  Homer  and Jonson to  Virgil : the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" ( Discoveries,  33). For  Lewis Theobald , too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,\" in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius.  Nicholas Rowe , to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of  Every Man in his Humour  to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s,  Edward Young  casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier,  Aphra Behn , writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from  Sallust  and  Cicero ,  Augustan  critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his  aesthetic  judgment.In this period,  Alexander Pope  is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.\" [56]  For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s,  Sarah Fielding  could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple.Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described.  Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg  translated parts of  Peter Whalley 's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution,  Edward Capell  offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\" [57]  The disastrous failures of productions of  Volpone  and  Epicoene  in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as  Earl Camden  and  William Gifford , he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.The  romantic  revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: \"He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.\" Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as  Thomas Middleton  or  John Heywood , who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however;  William Gifford , Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era,  Swinburne , who was more interested in Jonson than most  Victorians , wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance\" \u2013 by \"fragrance,\" Swinburne means spontaneity.In the 20th century, Jonson's body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in  The Sacred Wood ,  T. S. Eliot  attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by  E. E. Stoll  and  M. C. Bradbrook , provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived  sociopolitical criticism . Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of  patronage  and in the rising culture of mass media.Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'. [58]  If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of  John Donne . In this comparison, Jonson represents the  cavalier  strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the  metaphysical  school of poetry, with its reliance on strained,  baroque  metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ( Herbert Grierson  for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian  Edmund Bolton  named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic;  Herrick  described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\". [3]  All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of  wit . In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English  neoclassicism .The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \" On My First Sonne \"; \" To Celia \"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the  epitaph  on Salomon Pavy, a  boy player  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.It is in Jonson's  Timber, or Discoveries...  that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man\u2019s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to  The Isle of Dogs  (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work:  Richard Crookback  (1602);  Hot Anger Soon Cold  (1598), with Porter and  Henry Chettle ;  Page of Plymouth  (1599), with Dekker; and  Robert II, King of Scots  (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant:  The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors  (1607);  The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I  (1608); and  The May Lord  (1613\u201319).Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in  Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother , a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy  The Widow  was printed in 1652 as the work of  Thomas Middleton , Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as  The London Prodigal , have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses. [61].",

At Marlborough he knew  John Betjeman  and  Louis MacNeice ; at  Oxford   Stephen Spender , and he also came across  W. H. Auden . He edited  Oxford Poetry  in 1930-1931. He was not, however, drawn far into what was soon known as the  Auden Group ; he is identified much more with the type of poetry later exemplified by  Lawrence Durrell , and is for some critics the stand-out in the  Cairo poets . His potential was never quite fulfilled, partly because of poor health [ clarification needed ] .After graduation, he made a living from teaching and writing, marrying the actress  Norah Gibbs  in 1936. At that time he was collaborating on  Geoffrey Grigson 's  New Verse . In  World War II  he worked for the  British Council , in  Greece  and then  Egypt . There he edited the  Personal Landscape  magazine.After the war he continued to work for the  British Council , being posted to  Italy . Norah died in 1947, of  tuberculosis . He himself was ill for a time. Through other postings he wrote little.He was married again in 1961, to  Anne Marjoribanks . He died in  Vienna , apparently in an accident [ clarification needed ] , while once more in bad health.A conference on Spencer's life and work was held at the  University of Reading  in October 2009, with an exhibition of manuscripts and other personal effects.

They wrote things like \"Tired As I Can Be\" a lyric by BessieJackson.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: Lucille Bogan  (born  Lucile Anderson ; April 1, 1897 \u2013 August 10, 1948) [1]  was an American  classic female blues  singer and songwriter, among the first to be recorded. She also recorded under the pseudonym  Bessie Jackson . Music critic  Ernest Borneman  noted that Bogan was one of \"the big three of the blues\", along with  Ma Rainey  and  Bessie Smith . [2]  Many of Bogan's songs have been recorded by later blues and jazz musicians. [3]Many of her songs were sexually explicit, and she is generally considered to have been a \" dirty blues \" musician. [2]In 2022, she was inducted into the  Blues Hall of Fame . [4]She was born Lucile  [ sic ] Anderson, the daughter of Gussie and Wylie Anderson. [5]   According to some sources, she was born in  Amory ,  Mississippi , [6]  but according to her entry in the  1900 census  her birthplace was  Birmingham ,  Alabama . [5] [2]  In 1914, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan, a railwayman, and gave birth to a son, Nazareth Jr., in either 1915 or 1916. She later divorced Bogan and married James Spencer.She first recorded  vaudeville  songs for  Okeh Records  in New York in 1923, with the pianist Henry Callens. [6]  Later that year she recorded \"Pawn Shop Blues\" in  Atlanta, Georgia ; this was the first time a black blues singer had been recorded outside New York or Chicago. [7]  In 1927 she began recording for  Paramount Records  in  Grafton ,  Wisconsin , where she recorded her first big success, \"Sweet Petunia\", which was covered by  Blind Blake . She also recorded for  Brunswick Records , backed by  Tampa Red .By 1930, her songs tended to concern drinking and sex, such as \"Sloppy Drunk Blues\" (written and first recorded by Bogan but released first by  Leroy Carr  in 1930 then by Bogan the following year, later recorded by others) and \"Tricks Ain't Walkin' No More\" (later recorded by  Memphis Minnie ). She also recorded the original version of \" Black Angel Blues \", which (as \"Sweet Little Angel\") was covered by  B. B. King  and many others. With her experience in some of the rowdier  juke joints  of the 1920s, many of Bogan's songs, most of which she wrote herself, have thinly veiled humorous sexual references. The theme of prostitution, in particular, featured prominently in several of her recordings. One of these was \"Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)\", which was originally written and recorded by  Charlie \"Specks\" McFadden . [8] [9]   Piggly Wiggly  is the name of a successful American  supermarket  chain, operating in the  South  and the  Midwest , which first opened in 1916. [10]  Bogan used the self-service notion in her amended lyrics to the song, part of which ran, \"My name is Piggly Wiggly and I swear you can help yourself, And you've got to have your greenback, and it don't take nothin' else\". [11]In 1933, she returned to New York, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for the  Banner  label of  ARC . She was usually accompanied on piano by  Walter Roland , with whom she recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes, \"Seaboard Blues\", \"Troubled Mind\", and \"Superstitious Blues\". [2]  Her other songs include \"Stew Meat Blues\", \"Coffee Grindin' Blues\", \" My Georgia Grind \" (when accompanied on piano by  Charles Avery ), \"Honeycomb Man\", \"Mr. Screw Worm in Trouble\", and \"Bo Hog Blues\".Her final recordings with Roland and  Josh White  include two takes of \" Shave 'Em Dry \", recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs. [7]  According to Keith Briggs' liner notes for  Document Records  Complete Recordings, these were recorded either for the fun of the recording engineers, or for \"clandestine distribution as a 'Party Record ' \". Briggs notes that Bogan seems to be unfamiliar with the lyrics, reading them as she sings them, potentially surprised by them herself. [12]  Another of her songs, \"B.D. Woman's Blues\", takes the position of a \" bull dyke \" (\"B.D.\"), with the lyrics \"Comin' a time, B.D. women, they ain't gonna need no men\", \"They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man\" and \"They can lay their jive just like a natural man.\" [6]She appears not to have recorded after 1935. She managed her son's jazz group, Bogan's Birmingham Busters, for a time, before moving to Los Angeles shortly before her death from  coronary sclerosis  in 1948. [1]  She is interred at the Lincoln Memorial Park, in  Carson, California .In 2022, she was posthumously inducted into the  Blues Hall of Fame . [4]  The citation noted that \"Bogan recorded some of the most memorable blues songs of the pre-World War II era, including some that were landmarks in blues and some that continue to sensationalize her reputation decades after her death\".

[7]  In 2022,  St. Martin's Press  published Glose's  All the Ruined Men , a collection of linked short stories about veterans facing difficulties at home after years of war.  The Millions  named  All the Ruined Men  one of the most anticipated books of the second half of 2022. [8]  and in 2023,  All the Ruined Men , won the Library of Virginia Award for Fiction. [9]Publishers Weekly: \u201cGlose writes knowingly about the emotions that assault soldiers coming home from a combat zone and confronting a world that no longer makes sense... This sterling collection stands with Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Things They Carried.\u201d [17]Kirkus Reviews: \u201cGlose adds his impressive voice to those of writers like Kevin Powers and Phil Klay...A collection of painfully honest and consistently empathetic glimpses of modern American soldiers in war and peace.\u201d [18]Richard B. Myers  (General, USAF, Ret. 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff): \u201cBill Glose's poetry brings the last 12 years of war in the Middle East and Central Asia into sharp focus. He elicits all the many emotions that a soldier experiences and allows us a rare glimpse into how the people fighting and those caught up in conflict see war. Everyone will learn from this work.\u201d [19]Jackie Mohan: \u201cVirginia is in good hands as Glose's well-honed expertise with language and lyricism takes the reader on a journey across the state. While some poems ruminate on nature more generally, his poems are strongest when he describes the quirks and histories of specific locations, from Tangier Island to the James River to Norfolk, such as how Norfolk got its mermaids. His poems also tell the stories of the people he encountered along his way, from notable figures of times long gone, such as Capt. John Smith, to the lives of Virginians today.\u201d  [20]Lyn C. A. Gardner: \u201cThis accomplished collection by a Hampton Roads' poet touches both the horrors and wonders of human life, providing philosophical reflections about life and relationships and taking the time to understand and empathize with both strangers and family. Starting from his own encounters but reaching far beyond them, Bill Glose succeeds admirably at the difficult task of making the poet's specific, personal experience universal.\u201d [21].",

Reprinted with permission.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: William Smith Monroe  ( / m \u0259 n \u02c8 r o\u028a / ; September 13, 1911 [1]  \u2013 September 9, 1996) [2]  was an American  mandolinist , singer, and songwriter, who created the  bluegrass music  genre. Because of this, he is often called the \" Father of Bluegrass \". [3]The genre takes its name from his band, the  Blue Grass Boys , who named their group for the  bluegrass  of Monroe's home state of  Kentucky . He described the genre as \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\" [4]Monroe was born on  his family's farm  near  Rosine, Kentucky , the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \"Buck\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother,  James Pendleton \"Pen\" Vandiver , were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home. [1]Bill was of  Scottish  and  English  heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and  Charlie  already played the  fiddle  and  guitar , Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable  mandolin . [1]  He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly. [ citation needed ]Monroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later. [1]  Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, \"Uncle Pen\", recorded in 1950, [1]  and the 1972 album  Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.  On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe \"a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones.\" [5]Also significant in Monroe's musical life was  Arnold Shultz , an influential  fiddler  and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the  blues . [6] [7]In 1929, Monroe moved to  Indiana  to work at an oil refinery with his brothers  Birch  and Charlie. [1]  Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the \"Monroe Brothers\", to play at local dances and house parties.Birch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in  Shenandoah, Iowa ,  Nebraska ,  South Carolina  and  North Carolina  from 1934 to 1936. [1]   RCA Victor  signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936. [1]  They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song \"What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?\" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's  Bluebird  label between 1936 and 1938. [8]After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in  Little Rock, Arkansas , but the group only lasted for three months. [1]  Monroe then left Little Rock for  Atlanta, Georgia , to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys, [1]  with singer/guitarist  Cleo Davis , fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist  Amos Garren .In October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the  Grand Ole Opry , impressing Opry founder  George D. Hay  with his energetic performance of  Jimmie Rodgers 's \" Mule Skinner Blues \". [1]  Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist  Clyde Moody , fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks. [9]While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for  Columbia Records  featured an  accordion , soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added  banjo  player  David \"Stringbean\" Akeman  to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942. [1]  Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the  string-band tradition  from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.Key developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of  Lester Flatt  and  Earl Scruggs  to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945. [1]  Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler  Chubby Wise  and bassist  Howard Watts , who often performed under the name \"Cedric Rainwater\".In retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the \"Original Bluegrass Band\", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or \"breaks\" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model \"Lloyd Loar\" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career. [10]The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including \"Toy Heart\", \"Blue Grass Breakdown\", \" Molly and Tenbrooks \", \"Wicked Path of Sin\", \"My Rose of Old Kentucky\", \"Little Cabin Home on the Hill\", and Monroe's most famous song \" Blue Moon of Kentucky \", [1]  which was recorded by  Elvis Presley  in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for  Sun Records . Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's  rock and roll  cover of the song, originally a slow  ballad  in  waltz  time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit. [1]  Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the \"Blue Grass Quartet\", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar \u2013 Monroe's usual practice when performing \"sacred\" songs.Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the  Foggy Mountain Boys . In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the \"golden age\" of his career [11]  with what many consider the classic \"high lonesome\" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of  Jimmy Martin , the banjo of  Rudy Lyle  (replacing  Don Reno ), and fiddlers such as Merle \"Red\" Taylor,  Charlie Cline ,  Bobby Hicks , and  Vassar Clements .This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including \"My Little Georgia Rose\", \"On and On\", \"Memories of Mother and Dad\", and \"Uncle Pen\", as well as instrumentals such as \"Roanoke\", \"Big Mon\", \"Stoney Lonesome\", \"Get Up John\", and the mandolin feature \"Raw Hide\".  Carter Stanley  joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when  The Stanley Brothers  had temporarily disbanded.On January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck. [1]  He and \"Bluegrass Boys\" bass player,  Bessie Lee Mauldin , were returning home from a fox hunt north of  Nashville . On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring. [1]  In the meantime  Charlie Cline  and  Jimmy Martin  kept the band together. [12]By the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip. [1]  The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the \" Nashville sound \" in mainstream  country music  both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the  American folk music revival  of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.The word \"bluegrass\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers,  Reno and Smiley ,  Jim and Jesse , and the  Osborne Brothers . While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of  Ralph Rinzler , a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit. [1]  Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine  Sing Out!  that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \"father\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at  Roanoke, Virginia  in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure. [1]In 1964, before the  Grateful Dead  got together,  Jerry Garcia  caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe. [13]The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player  Bill Keith  and singer/guitarist  Peter Rowan  from Massachusetts, [1]  fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist  Roland White  and fiddler  Richard Greene  from California.Even after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.In 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at  Bean Blossom  in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951, [1]  which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual  Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival  is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival. [14]Monroe's compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals, including \"Jerusalem Ridge\", \"Old Dangerfield\" (originally spelled Daingerfield after  the town in East Texas ), [15]  and \"My Last Days on Earth\"; he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians. Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as  Emmylou Harris ,  Waylon Jennings , and  The Oak Ridge Boys , while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians. [1]  A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry. [1]  Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule. [1]  On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for  Farm Aid IV  in  Indianapolis , Indiana along with  Willie Nelson ,  John Mellencamp ,  Neil Young  and with many other artists.Monroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996. He ended his touring and playing career in April, following a stroke. Monroe died on September 9, 1996, in  Springfield, Tennessee , four days before his 85th birthday. [2] [16]According to Smithsonian Folkways, Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five ways:Bill Monroe was made an honorary  Kentucky Colonel  in 1966. [12]  He was inducted into the  Country Music Hall of Fame  in 1970, [1]  the  Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame  in 1971, [1]  and the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  (as an \"early influence\") in 1997.  Jimmie Rodgers ,  Bob Wills ,  Hank Williams Sr. , and  Johnny Cash  are the only other performers honored in all three. As the \"father of bluegrass\", he was also an inaugural inductee into the  International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor  in 1991. Monroe was a recipient of a 1982  National Heritage Fellowship  awarded by the  National Endowment for the Arts , which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. [17]  That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. In 1993, he received the  Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , and he was awarded the  National Medal of Arts  in 1995. His well-known song \" Blue Moon of Kentucky \" has been covered not only by bluegrass but also rock and country artists, most notably Elvis Presley,  Paul McCartney , and  Patsy Cline . In 2003,  CMT  had Bill Monroe ranked No. 16 on  CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music .Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, \"That ain't no part of nothin'.\" Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a \"musical giant\" and recognize that \"there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe.\" [18]More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists  Clyde Moody ,  Lester Flatt , Jack Cook,  Mac Wiseman ,  Jimmy Martin ,  Carter Stanley ,  Del McCoury ,  Peter Rowan ,  Roland White , Roland Dunn and  Doug Green ; banjo players  Earl Scruggs , Bob Black,  Butch Robins ,  Buck Trent ,  Don Reno ,  Stringbean ,  Sonny Osborne , and  Bill Keith ; and fiddlers Tommy Magness,  Chubby Wise ,  Vassar Clements ,  Byron Berline ,  Kenny Baker ,  Bobby Hicks ,  Gordon Terry ,  Randall Franks  and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso  Doc Watson .Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player  Ricky Skaggs  was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, \"I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: I think he's probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band.\" [19]In 1999, the portion of  Indiana State Road 135  running from  Morgantown  through to  Nashville, Indiana  was dedicated to Bill Monroe and is known as the Bill Monroe Memorial Highway.

He lectured at the University of Melbourne from 1945 to 1950,eventually moveing to Canberra, where he was foundation professor of English at Canberra University College, later to become the Australian National University, until 1969. He was instrumental in launching the first full university course in Australian literature.At the age of 8 he wrote his first poem for his mother's birthday. His first collection of poems, \\The Wandering Islands\\, was published in 1955. He went on to produce more than a dozen volumes each of poetry and criticism, winning many literature prizes and honours in Australia and, as his reputation grew, internationally. He was awarded an OBE in 1972, was made an AO in 1981 and was awarded four honorary degrees by Australian universities.Many considered AD Hope to have been an often controversial figure who used an erudite mind and a wicked wit to devastating effect as a critic. Critics of his work, however, found a romantic and passionate impulse within the formal constraints of some of his poetry. David Brooks, who edited AD Hope's most recent edition of poetry, considered that some of his poems were among the strongest poems ever written by an Australian,real praise indeed.When A D Hope retired from the Australian National University in 1969, the university gave him a fellowship and a room to allow him tocontinue on with his writing, which he did, producing numerous poems, critical essays and plays. A D Hope soldiered on alone for many years after the loss of his wife Penelope in 1988, but eventually moved into a nursing home where he suffered a series of very debilitating strokes.Alec Derwent Hope died in Canberra in July 2000., Alec Derwent Hope   AC   OBE  (21 July 1907 \u2013 13 July 2000) was an Australian  poet  and  essayist  known for his  satirical  slant. He was also a critic, teacher and academic.  He was referred to in an American journal as \"the 20th century's greatest 18th-century poet\". [1]Hope was born in  Cooma ,  New South Wales .  His father was a  Presbyterian  minister and his mother a teacher. [1]  He was educated partly at home and in  Tasmania , where they moved in 1911.  Three years later they moved to  Sydney . [1]  He attended  Fort Street High School , the  University of Sydney  whilst residing at  St. Andrew's College  and then the  University of Oxford  on a scholarship. Returning to Australia in 1931 he then trained as a teacher, and spent some time drifting. He worked as a  psychologist  with the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry, and as a lecturer in Education and English at  Sydney Teachers' College  (1937\u201344).He was a lecturer at the  University of Melbourne  from 1945 to 1950, and in 1951 became the first professor of English at the newly founded  Canberra University College , later of the  Australian National University  (ANU) when the two institutions merged.  At the ANU he and Tom Inglis Moore created the first full year course in Australian literature at an Australian university. [1]  He retired from the ANU in 1968 and was appointed Emeritus Professor. [2]He was appointed an Officer of the  Order of the British Empire  in 1972 [3]  and a Companion of the  Order of Australia  in 1981 [4]  and awarded many other honours. He died in  Canberra , having suffered  dementia  in his last years, and is buried at the  Queanbeyan  Lawn Cemetery.Although he was published as a poet while still young,  The Wandering Islands  (1955) was his first collection and all that remained of his early work after most of his manuscripts were destroyed in a fire. Its publication was delayed by concern about the effects of Hope's highly-erotic and savagely-satirical verse on the Australian public. His frequent allusions to sexuality in his work caused  Douglas Stewart  to dub him \"Phallic Alec\" in a letter to  Norman Lindsay . [5]  His influences were  Pope  and the  Augustan poets ,  Auden , and  Yeats . He was a polymath, very largely self-taught, and with a talent for offending his countrymen. He wrote a book of \"answers\" to other poems, including one in response to the poem \" To His Coy Mistress \" by  Andrew Marvell .The reviews he wrote in the 1940s and '50s were feared \"for their acidity and intelligence. If his reviews hurt some writers \u2013  Patrick White  included \u2013 they also sharply raised the standard of literary discussion in Australia.\" [6]  However, Hope relaxed in later years. As poet  Kevin Hart  writes, \"The man I knew, from 1973 to 2000, was invariably gracious and benevolent\". [6]Hope wrote in a letter to the poet and academic  Catherine Cole : \"Now I feel I've reached the pinnacle of achievement when you equate me with one of Yeats's 'wild, wicked old men'. I'm probably remarkably wicked but not very wild, I fear too much ingrained Presbyterian caution\". [7]  Cole suggests that Hope represented the three attributes that  Vladimir Nabokov  believed essential in a writer, \"storyteller, teacher, enchanter\". [7]Hope's editor and fellow critic was David Brooks who was responsible for posthumously publishing the Selected Poetry and Prose of AD Hope in January, 2000. [8]Kevin Hart, reviewing Catherine Cole's memoir of Hope, writes that \"When A. D. Hope died in 2000 at the age of 93, Australia lost its greatest living poet\". [6]  Hart goes on to say that when once asked what poets could do for Australia, Hope replied \"oh not much, merely justify its existence\". [7]In 1998 a celebration of his life and works,  The Scythe Honed Fine , was published by the  National Library of Australia .In 1937 he married Penelope Robinson.

Born in Cooma, New South Wales, in 1907, Hope's talent for poetry emerged at an early age when he wrote his first poem for his mother's birthday at just eight years old. This early interest in poetry set the stage for a prolific career that spanned decades and left an indelible mark on Australian literature.\n\nHope's academic pursuits played a significant role in shaping his literary career. He attended the University of Sydney and later the University of Oxford on a scholarship, showcasing his intellectual prowess. Upon returning to Australia in 1931, he trained as a teacher and worked in various roles before settling into academia. Hope lectured at the University of Melbourne from 1945 to 1950, and his critical mind and wit earned him a reputation as a formidable critic. His reviews, feared for their intelligence and acidity, raised the standard of literary discussion in Australia, though they also hurt some writers' feelings, including that of novelist Patrick White.\n\nIn 1951, Hope became the foundation professor of English at Canberra University College, which later became the Australian National University.

However, within these formal constraints, critics also detected a romantic and passionate impulse.\n\nBeyond his poetry, Hope was a prolific writer, producing numerous critical essays, plays, and even some fiction. He was a polymath, largely self-taught, and his knowledge spanned a wide range of subjects.

He produced a monumental edition of Manilius (5 vol., 1903\u201330), edited Juvenal (1905) and Lucan (1926), and wrote valuable classical papers., At first glance, it can be a major surprise that the author of the enormously popular poetry collection A Shropshire Lad was a classical scholar by the name of A.E. Housman. Alfred Edward Housman was born in Worcestershire, England, and he was profoundly affected by his mother&rsquo;s death when he was 12. This Cambridge University professor of Latin left no doubt about his priorities: the emendation of classical texts was both an intellectual search for the truth and his life&rsquo;s work; poetry was an emotional and physiological experience that began with a sensation in the pit of the stomach. The apparent discrepancies in this man who became both a first-rate scholar and a celebrated poet should be a reminder that, whatever else poetry does, it also records the interior life, a life that has its roots well beneath the academic gown or the business suit. Though Housman aspired to be a great scholar first, a look at his life and work reveals that he valued poetry more highly than he often admitted, and that many of the presumed conflicts between the classical scholar and the romantic poet easily dissolve in the personality of the man.\r\n\r\nThough the modern student is usually more interested in Housman&rsquo;s poetry than his textual criticism, a survey of his scholarship helps to appreciate his overall contribution as a scholar. From his early work on Propertius at Oxford University through his professorship at University College, London, and culminating in his office as Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University, Housman was not interested in the interpretation of the works of the classical writers he treated. Instead, he was solely involved in the investigation of manuscripts to establish reliable texts of their works. This process usually required the peeling away of centuries of errors made by previous editors, whom Housman frequently treated with scorn. In &ldquo;The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism,&rdquo; a paper presented to the Classical Association at Cambridge in 1921 and collected in John Carter&rsquo;s 1961 edition of the writer&rsquo;s prose, Housman described textual criticism as both a science and an art, requiring reason and common sense. As a science, however, it was not exact, he declared: &ldquo;A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas.&rdquo; Housman railed against the prevailing practice of accepting earlier manuscripts as better manuscripts or of accepting all readings&mdash;however inane&mdash;within a manuscript simply because of the authority of the whole. In this regard he criticized scholars for being lazy, and this tone of moral rectitude permeated the entire paper. Many scholars, he said, are stupid, lazy, vain&mdash;or all three. His last sentence put a cap on it: &ldquo;Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nConcerning Housman&rsquo;s own reputation as a classical scholar, D.R. Shackleton Bailey in a 1959 Listener article said that he was &ldquo;beyond serious dispute, among the greatest of all time.&rdquo; Bailey spoke of the scholar&rsquo;s &ldquo;passionate zeal to see each one of the innumerable problems in his text not as others had presented it or as he might have preferred it to appear but exactly as it was.&rdquo; According to John Bayley in the London Review of Books, Housman was &ldquo;a scholar worshipped and hated for his meticulous standards and his appalling sarcasms on the unscholarly.&rdquo; Housman&rsquo;s greatest single textual work was his five-volume edition of the Astronomica of Manilius, a first century CE. Latin poet. The first volume of this work was published in 1903 and the last in 1930. That Housman chose Manilius, a second-rate poet, over Propertius or any of the other better writers with whom he was familiar reveals his desire to establish for himself an unassailable reputation, for as Andrew S.F. Gow declared in A.E. Housman, the scholar realized that the Astronomica of Manilius provided him the greatest opportunity &ldquo;of approaching finality in the solution of the problems presented.&rdquo; In a letter to Housman&rsquo;s biographer Graves, G.P. Goold, a later holder of the Latin chair at University College, summed up the scholar&rsquo;s accomplishments: &ldquo;The legacy of Housman&rsquo;s scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about Latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work. &hellip; He was and may remain the last great textual critic. &hellip; And if we accord [Richard] Bentley the honour of being England&rsquo;s greatest Latinist, it will be largely because Housman declined to claim the title for himself.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt was at University College that Housman experienced his most sustained period of poetry composition, and the main fruit of this period was the publication of A Shropshire Lad in 1896. First offered to Macmillan Company in 1896 under the title &ldquo;Poems by Terence Hearsay,&rdquo; A Shropshire Lad was rejected by that publisher: it was brought out in the same year by Kegan Paul, with the change in the title suggested by Housman&rsquo;s friend Pollard. The book was published at the author&rsquo;s own expense, and he insisted that he receive no royalties. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been many anyway, since Kegan Paul printed only 500, and, as Maude M. Hawkins noted in A.E. Housman: Man Behind a Mask, the book &ldquo;sold so slowly that Laurence Housman at the end of two years bought up the last few copies.&rdquo; Though the volume was better appreciated in the United States than in England, Hawkins described most of the critical reviews as &ldquo;lukewarm or adverse.&rdquo; A Shropshire Lad did not sell well until it was published by Grant Richards, who became one of Housman&rsquo;s lifelong friends. Richards&rsquo;s first edition was 500 copies in 1897, which sold out; he then printed 1000 copies in 1900 followed by 2000 in 1902. &ldquo;After the slow stream of Housman readers from 1896 to 1903, the momentum of popularity increased rapidly,&rdquo; Hawkins wrote. &ldquo;During this period A Shropshire Lad had been reviewed in thirty-three periodicals with both praise and condemnation.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDuring the 20th century A Shropshire Lad has been more of a popular than a critical success. Looking back to the book&rsquo;s heyday, George Orwell remarked in Inside the Whale and Other Essays: &ldquo;Among people who were adolescent in the years 1910-25, Housman had an influence which was enormous and is now [1940] not at all easy to understand. In 1920, when I was about seventeen, I probably knew the whole of A Shropshire Lad by heart.&rdquo; Orwell suggested that what made the poem so popular was its snobbishness about belonging to the country; its adolescent themes of murder, suicide, unhappy love, and early death; and its &ldquo;bitter, defiant paganism, a conviction that life is short and the gods are against you, which exactly fitted the prevailing mood of the young.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn all of his poetry, Housman continually returns to certain favorite themes. The predominant theme, discussed by Cleanth Brooks in the Ricks collection of essays, is that of time and the inevitability of death. As Brooks said, &ldquo;Time is, with Housman, always the enemy.&rdquo; In the first poem of A Shropshire Lad, &ldquo;1887,&rdquo; one of the few to be titled, the conventional patriotism of the Queen&rsquo;s jubilee is shot through with the irony that God can only save the Queen with the help of those who have died for her sake: &ldquo;The saviours come not home tonight: / Themselves they could not save.&rdquo; Housman frequently deals with the plight of the young soldier, and he is usually able to maintain sympathy both for the youth who is the victim of war and for the patriotic cause of the nation. Robert B. Pearsall suggested in a 1967 PMLA essay that Housman dealt frequently with soldiers because &ldquo;the uniform tended to cure isolation and unpopularity, and soldiers characteristically bask in mutual affection.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt is not only war but nature, too, that brings on thoughts of death in Housman&rsquo;s poetry. In the famous Shropshire Lad lyric beginning &ldquo;Loveliest of trees, the cherry now,&rdquo; the speaker says that since life is all too short, he will go out &ldquo;To see the cherry hung with snow,&rdquo; an obvious suggestion of death. In a well-known verse from Last Poems, a particularly wet and old spring causes the speaker to move from a description of nature&mdash;&ldquo;The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers stream from the hawthorn on the wind away&rdquo;&mdash;to a sense that his lost spring brings one closer to the grave, which, in turn, occasions a splenetic remark about the deity: &ldquo;Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.&rdquo; To his credit, Housman rarely wallows in such pessimistic feelings but counsels a kind of stoical endurance as the proper response: &ldquo;Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.&rdquo; When the sky cannot be shouldered, a type of Roman suicide may be appropriate, as in &ldquo;Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?&rdquo; or in another Shropshire Lad poem, which ends with the lines: &ldquo;But play the man, stand up and end you, / When your sickness is your soul.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAnother frequent theme in Housman&rsquo;s poetry is the attitude that the universe is cruel and hostile, created by a God who has abandoned it. In the poem &ldquo;Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries&rdquo; in Last Poems, mercenaries must take up the slack for an uncaring deity: &ldquo;What God abandoned, these defended, / And saved the sum of things for pay.&rdquo; In such a world where &ldquo;malt does more than Milton can / To justify God&rsquo;s ways to man,&rdquo; as the lyricist wrote in A Shropshire Lad, poetry can serve the purpose of inuring one to the harshness of reality. R. Kowalczyk, in a 1967 Cithara essay, summed up this prevalent theme: &ldquo;Housman&rsquo;s poetic characters fail to find divine love in the universe. They confront the enormity of space and realize that they are victims of Nature&rsquo;s blind forces. A number of Housman&rsquo;s lyrics scrutinize with cool, detached irony the impersonal universe, the vicious world in which man was placed to endure his fated existence.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWithin such a universe, the pastoral theme of the preciousness of youth and youthful beauty is everywhere to be found. In &ldquo;To an Athlete Dying Young,&rdquo; the youth is praised for leaving a world with his accomplishments intact. Like the young girl Lucy in romantic poet William Wordsworth&rsquo;s lyrics, Housman&rsquo;s youths sometimes die into nature and become part of the natural surroundings: &ldquo;By brooks too broad for leaping / The lightfoot boys are laid; / The rose-lipt girls are sleeping / In fields where roses fade.&rdquo; But as Brooks declared, as recorded in Ricks&rsquo;s collection of essays, Housman&rsquo;s nature cannot be the same as Wordsworth&rsquo;s after the century&rsquo;s achievement in science: &ldquo;Housman&rsquo;s view of nature looks forward to our time rather than back to that of Wordsworth. If nature is lovely and offers man delight, she does not offer him solace or sustain him as Wordsworth was solaced and sustained. For between Wordsworth and Housman there interpose themselves Darwin and Huxley and Tindall&mdash;the whole achievement of Victorian science.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFurthermore, society sometimes intrudes into Housman&rsquo;s world of nature, and when it does, the rustic youth frequently comes in conflict with it. As Oliver Robinson wrote in Angry Dust: The Poetry of A.E. Housman, &ldquo;Housman is especially sympathetic with the man who is at odds with society, the man who cannot keep &lsquo;these foreign laws of God and man.&rsquo;&quot;\r\n\r\nThe themes of his poetry and his emotional handling of them mark Housman as an extension of the romantic movement that flourished in England in the early part of the 19th century and had a resurgence in the aesthetic movement of the 1890s. The critical evaluation of Housman&rsquo;s work in the two decades after his death in 1936 is tinged with the anti-romanticism of the period. The directness and simplicity of much of Housman&rsquo;s poetry were viewed as faults. According to Richard Aldington, influential critic I.A. Richards is rumored to have declared &ldquo;This had put us back ten years,&rdquo; after leaving Housman&rsquo;s Cambridge inaugural lecture And Cyril Connolly, in a 1936 New Statesman article reprinted in Ricks&rsquo;s essay collection, said that Housman&rsquo;s poems &ldquo;are of a triteness of technique equalled only by the banality of thought.&rdquo; He also talked about the limitations of the poet&rsquo;s themes of man&rsquo;s mortality and rebellion against his lot.\r\n\r\nTo see irony in Housman&rsquo;s poetic technique, however, is to mitigate some of what would otherwise be considered faults: the adolescent nature of some of the thought and the sentimental handling of it. Christopher Ricks, in the essay in his collection on Housman, noted that &ldquo;everyone seems to take it for granted that Housman&rsquo;s poems unwaveringly endorse the pessimistic beliefs which they assert. To me his poems are remarkable for the ways in which rhythm and style temper or mitigate or criticize what in bald paraphrase the poem would be saying.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether one finds irony in the author&rsquo;s poetic technique, it is true that Housman tried to place some distance between himself and his work. Referring to A Shropshire Lad in a letter written in 1933, Housman stated that &ldquo;very little in the book is biographical&rdquo; and said that his view of the world was &ldquo;owing to my observation of the world, not to personal circumstances.&rdquo; As to the county of Shropshire itself, Housman admitted in a letter to Maurice Pollet: &ldquo;I was born in Worcestershire, not Shropshire, where I have never spent much time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn his roles as classical scholar and as poet, Housman exhibited an unswerving integrity. While this integrity served him well in his classical endeavors, in his poetry it may have relegated him to a rank below that of the major poets of his age. His poetry, based as it is on emotion, never went beyond what he could verify with his own feelings. As Edmund Wilson said in an essay appearing in the Ricks collection, &ldquo;His world has no opening horizons; it is a prison that one can only endure. One can only come the same painful cropper over and over again and draw from it the same bitter moral.&rdquo; But few writers have expressed this dark if limited vision with more poignancy and clarity than Housman.\r\n\r\nHousman died in 1936 in Cambridge. A posthumous collection, called More Poems, was edited by his brother Laurence Housman., Alfred Edward Housman  ( / \u02c8 h a\u028a s m \u0259n / ; 26 March 1859 \u2013 30 April 1936) was an English  classical scholar  and poet. After an initially poor performance while at university, he took employment as a clerk in London and established his academic reputation by publishing as a  private scholar  at first.  Later Housman was appointed Professor of Latin at  University College London  and then at the  University of Cambridge . He is now acknowledged as one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars of any time. [1] [2]  His editions of  Juvenal ,  Manilius , and  Lucan  are still considered authoritative.In 1896, he emerged as a poet with  A Shropshire Lad , a cycle in which he poses as an unsophisticated and melancholy youth. After a slow start, this captured the imagination of young readers, its preoccupation with early death appealing to them especially during times of war. In 1922 his  Last Poems  added to his reputation, which was further enhanced by the large number of  song settings  drawn from these collections. Following his death, further poems from his notebooks were published by his brother,  Laurence . It was then too, though Housman had made no admission himself, that his sexual orientation began to be questioned.The eldest of seven children, Housman was born at Valley House in Fockbury, a hamlet on the outskirts of  Bromsgrove  in Worcestershire, to Sarah Jane (n\u00e9e Williams, married 17 June 1858 in  Woodchester , Gloucester) [3]  and Edward Housman (whose family came from  Lancaster ), and was baptised on 24 April 1859 at Christ Church, in  Catshill . [4] [5] [6]  His mother died on his twelfth birthday, and his father, a country solicitor, then  married an elder cousin , Lucy, in 1873. Two of his siblings became prominent writers, sister  Clemence Housman  and brother  Laurence Housman .Housman was educated at   King Edward's School  in  Birmingham  and later  Bromsgrove School , where he revealed his academic promise and won prizes for his poems. [6] [7]  In 1877, he won an open scholarship to  St John's College, Oxford , and went there to study  classics . [6]  Although  introverted  by nature, Housman formed strong friendships with two roommates, Moses John Jackson (1858 \u2013 14 January 1923)  and  A. W. Pollard . Though Housman obtained a first in classical  Moderations  in 1879,  his dedication to textual analysis led him to neglect the ancient history and philosophy that formed part of the  Greats  curriculum. Accordingly, he failed his  Finals  and had to return humiliated in  Michaelmas term  to resit the exam and at least gain a lower-level  pass degree . [8] [6]  Though some attribute Housman's unexpected performance in his exams directly to his unrequited feelings for Jackson, [9]  most biographers adduce more obvious causes. Housman was indifferent to philosophy and overconfident in his exceptional gifts, and he spent too much time with his friends. He may also have been distracted by news of his father's desperate illness. [10] [11] [12]After Oxford, Jackson went to work as a  clerk  in the  Patent Office  in London and arranged a job there for Housman too. [6]  The two shared a flat with Jackson's brother Adalbert until 1885, when Housman moved to lodgings of his own, probably after Jackson responded to a declaration of love by telling Housman that he could not reciprocate his feelings. [13]  Two years later, Jackson moved to India, placing more distance between himself and Housman. When he returned briefly to England in 1889, to marry, Housman was not invited to the wedding and knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892 and Housman commemorated him in a poem published as \"XLII \u2013 A.J.J.\" of  More Poems  (1936).Meanwhile, Housman pursued his classical studies independently, and published scholarly articles on  Horace ,  Propertius ,  Ovid ,  Aeschylus ,  Euripides  and  Sophocles . [6]  He also completed an edition of  Propertius , which however was rejected by both  Oxford University Press  and  Macmillan  in 1885, and was destroyed after his death. He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered and accepted the professorship of Latin at  University College London  (UCL). [6]  When, during his tenure, an immensely rare  Coverdale Bible  of 1535 was discovered in the UCL library and presented  to the Library Committee, Housman (who had become an atheist while at Oxford) [14]  remarked that it would be better to sell it to \"buy some really useful books with the proceeds\". [15]Although Housman's early work and his responsibilities as a professor included both  Latin  and  Greek , he began to specialise in Latin poetry. When asked later why he had stopped writing about Greek verse, he responded, \"I found that I could not attain to excellence in both.\" [16]  In 1911 he took the  Kennedy Professorship of Latin  at  Trinity College, Cambridge , where he remained for the rest of his life.Between 1903 and 1930, Housman published his critical edition of  Manilius's   Astronomicon  in five volumes. He also edited  Juvenal  (1905) and  Lucan  (1926). G. P. Goold, Classics Professor at University College, wrote of his predecessor's accomplishments that \"the legacy of Housman's scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about Latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work \u2026 He was and may remain the last great textual critic\". [2]  In the eyes of   Harry Eyres , however, Housman was \"famously dry\" as a professor, and his influence led to a scholarly style in the study of literature and poetry that was philological and without emotion. [17]Many colleagues were unnerved by Housman's scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship. [6]  In his paper \"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\" (1921) he wrote: \"A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like  Newton  investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas\". He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: \"Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head\". [2] [18]His younger colleague,  A. S. F. Gow , quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they \"were often savage in the extreme\". [19]  Gow also related how Housman intimidated students, sometimes reducing the women to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember the names of female students, maintaining that \"had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension\". Among the more notable students at his Cambridge lectures was  Enoch Powell , [20]  one of whose own Classical emendations was later complimented by Housman. [21]In his private life, Housman enjoyed country walks,  gastronomy , air travel and making frequent visits to France, where he read \"books which were banned in Britain as pornographic\" [22]  but he struck  A. C. Benson , a fellow don, as being \"descended from a long line of maiden aunts\". [23]  His feelings about his poetry were ambivalent and he certainly treated it as secondary to his scholarship. He did not speak in public about his poems until 1933, when he gave a lecture \"The Name and Nature of Poetry\", arguing there that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.Housman died, aged 77, in Cambridge. His ashes are buried just outside  St Laurence's Church, Ludlow . A cherry tree was planted there in his memory (see  A Shropshire Lad  II) and replaced by the Housman Society in 2003 with a new cherry tree nearby. [6] [24]Loveliest of trees, the cherry now \nIs hung with bloom along the bough, \nAnd stands about the woodland ride \nWearing white for Eastertide. \n \nNow, of my threescore years and ten, \nTwenty will not come again, \nAnd take from seventy springs a score, \nIt only leaves me fifty more. \n \nAnd since to look at things in bloom \nFifty springs are little room, \nAbout the woodlands I will go \nTo see the cherry hung with snow. [25]\u2014 A Shropshire Lad : \"Loveliest of trees, the cherry now\"During his years in London, Housman completed  A Shropshire Lad , a cycle of 63 poems. After one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. Its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before  World War I , when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. The book has been in print continuously since May 1896. [26]The poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation (Housman had become an atheist while still an undergraduate). Housman wrote many of them while living in  Highgate , London, before ever visiting Shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'. [27]  Housman himself acknowledged that \"No doubt I have been unconsciously influenced by the Greeks and Latins, but [the] chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare's songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and  Heine \". [28]Housman began collecting a new set of poems after the First World War. His early work was an influence on many British  poets  who became famous by their writing about the war, and he wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. This included his  Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries , honouring the  British Expeditionary Force , an elite but small force of professional soldiers sent to Belgium at the start of the war. In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death. [6]  These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in  A Shropshire Lad  but lack its consistency. He published his new collection as  Last Poems  (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime.After Housman's death in 1936, his brother,  Laurence  published further poems in  More Poems  (1936),  A. E .H.: Some Poems, Some Letters and a Personal Memoir by his Brother  (1937), and  Collected Poems  (1939).  A. E. H.  includes humorous verse such as a parody of  Longfellow's  poem  Excelsior . Housman also wrote a parodic  Fragment of a Greek Tragedy , in English, first published in 1883 in  The Bromsgrovian , the magazine of his old school, and frequently reprinted. [29] [30]John Sparrow  quoted a letter written late in Housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:Poetry was for him \u2026'a morbid secretion', as the pearl is for the oyster. The desire, or the need, did not come upon him often, and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed; then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort, or any consciousness of composition on his part. Sometimes they wanted a little alteration, sometimes none; sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later, spontaneously or with 'a little coaxing'; sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head.  That... was a long and laborious process. [31]Sparrow himself adds, \"How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in  A Shropshire Lad . Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which.\" [31]In 1942, Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled \"A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'\" in the  British Library , with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housman's homosexuality and his love for Moses Jackson. [32]  Despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, Housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in  A Shropshire Lad , about his deeper sympathies. Poem XXX of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how \"Fear contended with desire\": \"Others, I am not the first, / Have willed more mischief than they durst\". In  More Poems , he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave: [33]Because I liked you better \n    Than suits a man to say, \nIt irked you, and I promised \n    To throw the thought away.To put the world between us \n    We parted, stiff and dry; \n\"Good-bye,\" said you, \"forget me.\" \n    \"I will, no fear,\" said I. \n \nIf here, where clover whitens \n    The dead man's knoll, you pass, \nAnd no tall flower to meet you \n    Starts in the trefoiled grass, \n \nHalt by the headstone naming \n    The heart no longer stirred, \nAnd say the lad that loved you \n    Was one that kept his word. [34]His poem \"Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?\", written after the trial of  Oscar Wilde , addressed more general attitudes towards homosexuals. [35]  In the poem the prisoner is suffering \"for the colour of his hair\", a natural quality that, in a coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as \"nameless and abominable\" (recalling the legal phrase  peccatum illud horribile, inter Christianos non nominandum , \"that horrible sin, not to be named amongst Christians\").Housman's poetry, especially  A Shropshire Lad , was set to music by many British, and in particular English, composers in the first half of the 20th century. The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in English music. [36]  In 1904, the cycle  A Shropshire Lad  was set by  Arthur Somervell , who in 1898 had begun to develop the concept of the English  song-cycle  in his version of  Tennyson 's \" Maud \". [37]   Stephen Banfield  believes it was acquaintance with Somervell's cycle that led other composers to set Housman:  Ralph Vaughan Williams  is likely to have attended the first performance at the  Aeolian Hall  on 3 February 1905. [38]  His well-known cycle of six songs  On Wenlock Edge , for  string quartet ,  tenor  and piano, was published in 1909. Between 1909 and 1911,  George Butterworth  produced settings in two collections,  Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad  and  Bredon Hill and Other Songs . He also wrote the orchestral  tone poem   A Shropshire Lad , first performed at  Leeds  Festival in 1912. [39]Ivor Gurney  was another composer who made renowned settings of Housman's poems. Towards the end of  World War I , he was working on his cycle  Ludlow and Teme , for voice and string quartet (published in 1919), [40]  and went on to compose the eight-song cycle  The Western Playland  in 1921. [41]  One more who set Housman songs during this period was  John Ireland  in the song cycle,  The Land of Lost Content  (1920\u201321).  Charles Wilfred Orr  produced 24 Housman settings in songs and song cycles composed from the 1920s into the 1950s. [42]  Even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as  Arnold Bax ,  Lennox Berkeley  and  Arthur Bliss , were attracted to Housman's poetry.Housman's attitude to musical interpretations of his poetry, and indeed to music in general, was either indifference or torment. He told his friend  Percy Withers  that he knew nothing of music and it meant nothing to him. Withers once played him a record of the Vaughan Williams setting, but realised he had made a mistake when he saw the look of disgust on the poet's face. [43]  Nevertheless, by 1976, a catalogue listed 400 musical settings of Housman's poems. [36]  As of 2023, Lieder Net Archive records 646 settings of 188 texts. [44]The earliest commemoration of Housman was in the chapel of Trinity College in Cambridge, where there is a memorial brass on the south wall. [45]  The Latin inscription was composed by his colleague there,  A. S. F. Gow , who was also the author of a biographical and bibliographical sketch published immediately following his death. [46]  Translated into English, the memorial reads:This inscription commemorates Alfred Edward Housman, who was for twenty-five years Kennedy Professor of Latin and Fellow of the College. Following in  Bentley 's footsteps he corrected the transmitted text of the Latin poets with so keen an intelligence and so ample a stock of learning, and chastised the sloth of editors with such sharp mockery, that he takes his place as the virtual second founder of these studies. He was also a poet who, with a slender sheaf of verses, claimed for himself a secure place on our Helicon. He died on 30th April 1936 at the age of seventy-six. [47]From 1947, University College London's academic common room was dedicated to his memory as the Housman Room. [48]   Blue plaques  followed later elsewhere, the first being on Byron Cottage in Highgate in 1969, recording the fact that  A Shropshire Lad  was written there. More followed, placed on his Worcestershire birthplace, his homes and school in Bromsgrove. [49]  The latter were encouraged by the Housman Society, which was founded in the town in 1973. [50]  Another initiative was the statue in Bromsgrove High Street, showing the poet striding with walking stick in hand. The work of local sculptor Kenneth Potts, it was unveiled on 22 March 1985. [51]The blue plaques in Worcestershire were set up on the centenary of  A Shropshire Lad  in 1996. In September of the same year, a memorial window lozenge was dedicated at  Poets' Corner  in  Westminster Abbey [52]  The following year saw the premi\u00e8re of  Tom Stoppard 's play  The Invention of Love , whose subject is the relationship between Housman and Moses Jackson.

        "response": "## Alfred Edward Housman: A Life in Poetry and Letters\n\nAlfred Edward Housman, known as A.E. Housman, was an English poet and classical scholar whose work continues to exert a strong influence on modern poetry. Born in Worcestershire, England, in 1859, Housman's life was marked by tragedy and loss from an early age. His mother died on his twelfth birthday, a trauma that would leave a lasting impression on the young poet. \n\nAfter completing his early education, Housman attended St. John's College, Oxford, where he excelled in classical studies. However, he failed his final exams, a setback that would shape his future career path. In 1882, Housman moved to London and took up a position as a clerk in the Patent Office. It was during this period that he began to publish his first scholarly articles on classical authors such as Horace, Propertius, and Aeschylus. Despite his initial failure at Oxford, Housman's intellectual prowess was soon recognized, and in 1892, he was appointed Professor of Latin at University College London. \n\nIt was during his time in London that Housman began to write poetry in earnest. His first collection, \"A Shropshire Lad,\" was published in 1896 and marked a turning point in his career. The poems in this volume reflect Housman's preoccupation with death, loss, and the passing of time, themes that would recur throughout his poetic oeuvre. \"A Shropshire Lad\" also reveals Housman's affinity for nature and the English countryside, presenting an idealized vision of rural life that contrasts sharply with the harsh realities of urban existence in late Victorian England. \n\nIn 1911, Housman accepted a position as Kennedy Professor of Latin at Trinity College, Cambridge, a post he would hold until his retirement in 1933. During his tenure at Cambridge, Housman continued to publish scholarly editions of classical texts, including works by Juvenal, Manilius, and Lucan. He was renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and his scathing critiques of what he considered shoddy scholarship. \n\nWhile Housman's academic career was distinguished and influential, it is for his poetry that he is best remembered. His second collection, \"Last Poems,\" was published in 1922 and cemented his reputation as a leading poet of the early 20th century. These poems explore similar themes to those in \"A Shropshire Lad,\" but with a greater maturity and depth of emotion. \n\nHousman's poetry is characterized by a spare, unadorned style, often employing colloquial language and a conversational tone. His poems frequently take the form of ballads or lyric poems, and he favored traditional forms such as the sonnet. Nature is a recurring motif, as are themes of mortality, the passing of youth, and the cruelty of fate. \n\nIn addition to his published works, Housman left behind a substantial body of unpublished poems, which were collected and published posthumously by his brother, Laurence Housman. These poems reveal a more personal and intimate side to the poet, often exploring his experiences of unrequited love and his struggles with his sexual orientation. \n\nHousman died in 1936 and is buried in the churchyard of St. Laurence's Church in Ludlow, Shropshire. His legacy as a poet and scholar continues to be celebrated, and his work has inspired numerous musical settings and adaptations, ensuring his enduring influence on English literature and culture.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Alan Patrick Herbert was born in Elstead, Surrey in 1890. After studying law at Oxford University he served in the Royal Navy during the First World War. After the war he published the novel The Secret Battle (1919).In 1924 Herbert joined Punch Magazine and two years later had his first theatrical success with the production of Riverside Nights. He also wrote the lyrics for Tantivy Towers (1930) and Helen (1932) and published the novels The Water Gipsies (1930), Holy Deadlock and What a Word (1935). Herbert became the Independent MP for Oxford University in 1935. A campaigner for reform of the marriage and divorce laws, played an important role in the, Sir Alan Patrick Herbert   CH  (known as  A. P. Herbert ; 24 September 1890 \u2013 11 November 1971), was an English humorist, novelist, playwright, law reformist, and, from 1935 to 1950, an  independent  Member of Parliament for  Oxford University .Born in  Ashtead ,  Surrey , he attended  Winchester College  and  New College, Oxford , receiving a starred first in  jurisprudence  in 1914. He joined the  Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve  as a seaman in the  First World War , becoming an officer in the  Royal Naval Division . He fought in  Gallipoli  and on the  Western Front , as a battalion  adjutant  in 1917, before injury removed him from the front line. After the war he published  The Secret Battle  and in 1924 joined the staff of  Punch . As an MP he campaigned for private-member rights, piloted the  Matrimonial Causes Act 1937  through Parliament, opposed Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the  Oxford Group . He joined the River Emergency Service in 1938, captaining a boat on the  River Thames  in the  Second World War  as a petty officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. In 1943, he joined a parliamentary commission on the future of the  Dominion of Newfoundland .Herbert was born at Ashtead Lodge,  Ashtead , Surrey, on 24 September 1890. His father, Patrick Herbert Coghlan Herbert (1849\u20131915), was a civil servant (assistant secretary of the Judicial and Public Department) [1] [2]  in the  India Office , of Irish origin, [3]  and his mother, Beatrice Eugenie (n\u00e9e Selwyn), was the daughter of  Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn , a  Lord Justice of Appeal . [4]  His two younger brothers both died in battle: Owen William Eugene,  Second lieutenant ,  Royal Field Artillery , killed at  Mons  in 1914, and Sidney Jasper,  Captain   R.N. , killed 1941 aboard  HMS  Hood . [5]  His mother died of  tuberculosis  when he was eight, shortly before he left for The Grange in  Folkestone , a  preparatory school . [6]Herbert then attended  Winchester College , winning the King's Medal for English Verse and the King's Medal for English Speech, presented by Prime Minister  H. H. Asquith . He took an active part in the college debating and Shakespeare societies. As a Winchester student, Herbert sent verses to the offices of  Punch  and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor,  Owen Seaman . Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the college's three football divisions. [7]Herbert went to  New College, Oxford  as an  exhibitioner . He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the  Tariff Reform League , speaking  extempore  on  home rule . His first contribution to  Punch  was printed on 24 August 1910: a set of verses entitled \"Stones of Venus\". He went up to Oxford in October and made his first speech at the  Oxford Union  in November. His work began appearing not only in  Punch , but in  The Observer , the  Pall Mall Gazette  and  Vanity Fair . [8]Herbert received a \"not very good Second\" in  Honour Moderations , and apparently disenchanted with  Classics , changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with  Walter Monckton  and others and was good friends with the notables  Duff Cooper ,  Harold Macmillan  and  Philip Guedalla . Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914 with \"a very good First\" in  Jurisprudence . He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at  Oxford House  in  Bethnal Green  for a year. He spent the time \"doing what I could:\" washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money. [9]On 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an  ordinary seaman  in the  Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve , which later became one of the constituent bodies of the  Royal Naval Division . In early October, news reached him that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \"missing, believed killed\" in the retreat from  Mons . Herbert reached the rank of acting  leading seaman  before being commissioned as a  sub-lieutenant  in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the  63rd (Royal Naval) Division ). [10]\"C\" and \"D\" companies of the Hawke Battalion left for  Gallipoli  in early 1915, briefly stopping in  Malta  before arriving at the  Moudros  on 17 May, and finally reaching Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert took command of No. 11 Platoon, \"C\" Company, composed mostly of  Tynesiders  and also two men from a remote  Durham  mining town. A week after his arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the  Third Battle of Krithia . In July 1915, Herbert went down with illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \"fit for light duty\", he was seconded to the  Naval Intelligence Division  at  Whitehall . It was then that he decided to rent No. 12  Hammersmith Terrace  as a dwelling. [11] [12]In summer 1916, when he was passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in  Abbeville , where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at  Souchez  in July 1916, and in mid-November it took part in an attack on  Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre  during the  Battle of the Ancre , which saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers to come out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at  Pozi\u00e8res  in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on  Gavrelle , west of  Arras . [12] [13]On medical leave back in England after the injury, Herbert began writing his first book,  The Secret Battle , which he finished \"in a few weeks\". He was elected a member of the Savage Club and raised by  Punch  to the \"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\" [14]  On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed from  Liverpool  in a convoy for  Alexandria , as assistant to the  Commodore . After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit several places on the North African coast, and from  Tunis  took a train to  Constantine, Algeria  and then to  Algiers . On 11 November, he went by train from  Oran  to  Tlemcen . Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. As he wrote, \"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\" [15]Herbert was granted shore leave at  Gibraltar  and took the chance to travel to  Seville , then to  C\u00f3rdoba . He arrived in  Madrid  on 22 November and dined with the Embassy's naval attach\u00e9, Captain John Harvey, as well as  Filson Young  and others, before making the return journey to Gibraltar. [16]The Secret Battle  was recommended to  Methuen Publishing  by  E. V. Lucas  and announced in their spring list in 1919. It was \"read all night\" by Prime Minister  Lloyd George , who brought it to the attention of  Churchill , then  Secretary of State for War .  Montgomery  saw it as \"the best story of front line war\" and Herbert himself believed that court-martial arrangements were subsequently \"altered in some way\" as a result of the book. However, the book had no great commercial success, which his biographer  Reginald Pound  puts down to the fact that \"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\" [17]Herbert was  called to the Bar  by  Inner Temple  in 1919 and entered the chambers of  Leslie Scott . He was joined by two Oxford friends,  Walter Monckton  and  Henry Strauss , who were called on the same day. Although he spent time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later said he was \"forever sorry\" not to be \"of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\" [18]Unable to sustain himself on  Punch ' s \"eccentric rates of payment\", Herbert wrote his second book,  The House by the River , in two months. It was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to  The House by the River  and published a collection of his prose submissions to  Punch  under the title  Light Articles Only . [19]In January 1924,  Owen Seaman , the editor of  Punch , invited Herbert to join its staff. Herbert accepted and his accession meant he would receive a salary of \u00a350 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of  Punch , where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in  Melbourne , where it was described as \"delectably witty\" by  Sir Harry Brittain . [20]In 1926, Herbert was invited by  Nigel Playfair  to write \"an entertainment\" for the  Lyric Theatre , Hammersmith. The result was  Riverside Nights , performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play,  The White Witch , was performed at  Haymarket Theatre  in September 1926.Herbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence.  Hewart, LCJ  ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within  parliamentary privilege . Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, it led to a unique situation of uncertainty as to \"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\" [21]  The following year Herbert published  Uncommon Law , and Hewart contributed a generous introduction.Herbert first had the idea of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the  1935 general election , when he ran into  Frederick Lindemann , who had just been rejected as  Conservative  candidate for  Oxford University . Herbert decided to stand as an  Independent , aided by  Frank Pakenham  as his  election agent . Herbert wrote an \"unconventional\" 5,000-word  election address , which included the statement, \"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\" [22]Herbert was elected as an Independent supporter of the  National Government . [23]  Defying the advice of more experienced members, including  Austen Chamberlain , he made his  maiden speech  on 4 December 1935, the second day of the opening session of the new Parliament. He protested to Prime Minister  Stanley Baldwin  on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over  private member's bills . He went into the \"No\" lobby alongside the members of the  Independent Labour Party  and fellow University member  Eleanor Rathbone , but the motion was passed by 232 to 5. [24]  Churchill praised Herbert for his \"composure and aplomb\" and famously said: \"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\" [25]  During the speech, Herbert promised to introduce his  Matrimonial Causes Bill  into law by the end of the Parliament. [22]Herbert's novel  Holy Deadlock  (1934) deals at length with the inconsistencies of English divorce law.  Malavika Rajkotia  writes that \"This novel sparked off the first divorce law reform movement in England, which led to the passing of the  Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 \". [26]  In 1936, Herbert failed to be drawn in the private members' ballot but managed to get the Conservative  Rupert De la B\u00e8re  to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937. It allowed divorce to be given without requiring proof of  adultery , but fake adulteries and bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the  Divorce Reform Act 1969  came into force in 1971. [ citation needed ]During the prewar period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse. [27]  Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \"temporary, war-time tax\" in 1916. [28]  In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with  William Mabane , and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer  Sir John Simon  reduced the duty. [29]  Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937 by making a speech that was received with \"loud laughter\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to  Punch , \"an astonishing occasion\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938. [30]Herbert was also a fervent opponent of the  Oxford Group  and its leader,  Frank Buchman . In particular, he opposed the use of \"Oxford\" in its name and its supposed association with the  University of Oxford . He was supported by the university in his endeavours, particularly by the  Oxford Union , which unanimously passed a resolution in support of him. Support for Herbert was also expressed by  H. A. L. Fisher , the Warden of  New College, Oxford , and  Douglas Veale , the  Registrar of the University of Oxford . [31]On 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the  Water Gipsy , in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the  Port of London Authority . [32]  Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raids and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to its war stations. Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the  Royal Institute of British Architects ,  Victor Pasmore ,  Magnus Pyke  and  John Pudney . At the sounding of the first air-raid siren in London in 1939, the  Water Gipsy  was anchored off the Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the  Water Gipsy  as the only naval vessel in sight before they saluted it. [33]During the Second World War, Herbert was the only  non-commissioned officer  in the  House of Commons , and he wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, although he once appeared before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's  war cabinet  when asked by saying, \"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\" [34]Herbert was sent to  Newfoundland and Labrador  in 1943 with  Derrick Gunston  and  Charles Ammon  as members of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence, rather than Confederation with Canada.After his re-election in the  1945 general election  on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\" The  Labour Party , under  Clement Attlee , had won 393 seats and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs, \"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty\". Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including ones covering betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of  decree nisi . However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time, which was restored later in the Parliament. [35]In autumn 1945,  George Orwell  had the essay  Notes on Nationalism  published in the magazine  Polemic  and named Herbert as one of the followers of \"neo-Toryism\", who were marked by a \"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined.\" [36]  Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, noted, \"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\" [37]From July 1945 to 1946, Herbert worked on the  libretto  for  Charles B. Cochran 's new musical,  Big Ben . It opened at the  Adelphi Theatre  on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill,  Montgomery , Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran himself was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high and so there was no fortune in it for Cochran or for Herbert. [38]  Its run was over at the end of 1946, after 172 performances. [39]  Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical,  Bless the Bride , which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two-and-a-quarter years, was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert, and was Cochran's most successful musical. [40]  It includes the hit song ' Ma Belle Marguerite '. [41]Herbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by  Raymond Evershed , investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the  1948 Summer Olympics  in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the  Festival of Britain  to be held in 1951. At the time, he was already a member of the  Thames Conservancy Board , a trustee of the  National Maritime Museum , president of the  Inland Waterways Association  and a vice president of the  Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety . In addition he authored a critical study of  royal commissions  for the  Institute of Economic Affairs , which was dismissed for its \"light touch\". Herbert commented: \"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\" [42]Herbert was re-elected in the  1945 general election  and continued as an MP until  University seats  were abolished in 1950 under the  Representation of the People Act 1948 . [43]  Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was strongly in favour of the  Festival of Britain . [22]  He was  knighted  in 1945 in  Winston Churchill 's  Resignation Honours . [44]   The Times  noted \"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\" [45]In 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons:  Independent Member  (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951). Ten years later he was the subject of a  This Is Your Life  TV programme in 1961, when he was surprised by  Eamonn Andrews .Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, daughter of  Harry Quilter , in the summer of 1914. [46]  They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by  Frederic Iremonger , Vicar of St James the Great in  Bethnal Green . Herbert wore his formal dress uniform as an Acting Leading Seaman for the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in  Fulham Road . [47]Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected in 1966 as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club [48]  and was a well-known face on the chess circuit. [49]  They had four children: Crystal, Lavender,  Jocelyn  and John.Herbert loved the River Thames. He lived beside it at  Hammersmith , West London. He was a member of the  Thames Conservancy Board  and a Freeman of the  Company of Watermen and Lightermen . [ citation needed ]In 1966, he wrote a book,  The Thames  ( Weidenfeld & Nicolson ), in which he explored the \"machinery\" of the river in all its aspects. [ citation needed ]In the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to  Middlesex Hospital  in  Fitzrovia , after a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, but over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to  The Times , an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr  Harold Wilson \" and of the \"marine activities\" of  Edward Heath . By then, he was describing himself as \"a recumbent nuisance\".A. P. Herbert died on 11 November 1971. Obituaries were published in  The Times  and in  Punch .  The Times  accompanied its obituary notice with a leading article, saying he had done \"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\" [50]A memorial service on 6 December in the church of  St Martin-in-the-Fields  which was \"crowded to overflowing\". On 7 December, the  Congressional Record  of the  US House of Representatives  appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the  Library of Congress , later said that there was \"[no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\" [50]In a 1957 article entitled \"Over Seventy\", lamenting the decline of the humorist,  P. G. Wodehouse  wrote: \"I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an  Alex Atkinson  in every  local .\"The title of  Alexandra Fuller 's 2001 memoir  Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood  is taken from a Herbert quote, \"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\" [51]Starting in 1910, he contributed regularly to  Punch . One series of his that it took was  Misleading Cases in the Common Law  \u2013 the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \" law reports \" or \" legal judgments \" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is  Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock ,  also known as \"The Negotiable Cow\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \"Smith's Leading Cases\". Herbert often referred to himself as \"A. P. Haddock\" in skits in  Punch  magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.Thanks to their realism, Herbert's satires were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers, both in Britain and elsewhere, as factual. One of the \"cases\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \"doing what you like\", was sharply criticised by an American  law review  article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity. [52]  As such, Herbert's contributions are examples of the literary technique known as  false document . Whereas in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as  Henry de Bracton , they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagining, such as \"Wedderburn on Water Courses\" and \"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\".More importantly, the cases were Herbert's vehicles for law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often made cogent legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are consequently sometimes quoted in judicial decisions, [53]  and are also the subject of academic research. [54] [55]Over his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled  Misleading Cases in the Common Law ,  More Misleading Cases ,  Still More Misleading Cases ,  Codd's Last Case  and  Bardot M.P.? . Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as  General Cargo . Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes,  Uncommon Law  in 1935 and  More Uncommon Law  in 1982.

Kramer\u2019s 1937 poem \u201cThe Shoe-Shine Boy\u201d published when he was only fifteen years old. [1]  He adopted traditional meters\u2014favoring iambic trimeters, tetrameters, and pentameter\u2014in part to install a radical politics within inherited rhythms. His earliest poems about the suppression of freedoms in the United States date from 1938 and continued writing them through the 1980s.

Slavery and abolition were frequent themes of his early work (\"Denmark Vesey,\" \"The Ballad of August Biondi\").

Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1830, she lived a largely introverted life, choosing to forgo traditional social norms and instead, devote herself to her poetry and the natural world. Dickinson's work often reflects her unique perspective and emotional depth, with many of her poems exploring abstract concepts through vivid imagery and innovative language. Her writing process was intimate and solitary, resulting in a vast collection of nearly 1800 poems that remained largely unpublished during her lifetime. It was only after her death in 1886 that her sister, Lavinia, discovered the treasure trove of poetry and ensured their publication, introducing the world to the genius of Emily Dickinson. Despite her initial obscurity, she is now considered one of America's greatest and most influential poets, with her works continuing to inspire and captivate audiences today."

He served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, leading the Union during the American Civil War. He died in Washington, D.C. on April 15, 1865., Abraham Lincoln was born 12 February 1809 near Hodgenville, Kentucky, and grew up with little formal schooling. Self-educated, he was eventually elected to the Illinois House of Representatives and served from 1834 to 1842. Admitted to the bar in 1836, Lincoln used law as a gateway into politics, which dominated his life. He became Vice-Presidential candidate for the (new) Republic Party in 1856 and was elected 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 to his assassination by John Wilkes Booth in Washington on April 15, 1865. Lincoln's slave emancipation principles led to the civil war between the North and the South in 1861. He was survived by his wife Mary, The 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln worked as a lawyer and served in the Illinois General Assembly for eight years and in the House of Representatives for a year before winning the Republican nomination for president in 1860. As president during the Civil War, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863. He was re-elected as president in 1864 and served until his assassination in 1865, a few weeks after the Civil War ended.  &nbsp; Lincoln wrote poetry as a teenager, mostly satirical verse and short stanzas on the flyleaves of books. He worked on a longer poem in quatrains in 1846, &ldquo;My Childhood Home I See Again,&rdquo; which he sent in a letter to Andrew Johnston, a fellow lawyer in Illinois. In 1863, Lincoln wrote lines of verse on the occasion of Lee&rsquo;s invasion of the North. In a 2004 article for the Abraham Lincoln Association&rsquo;s newsletter, Richard Lawrence Miller attributed an unsigned poem titled &ldquo;The Suicide&rsquo;s Soliloquy&rdquo; to Lincoln. The poem, a melodramatic persona poem, originally appeared in the Sangamo Journal, a Springfield, Illinois, newspaper, in 1838. \r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;, Abraham Lincoln  ( / \u02c8 l \u026a \u014b k \u0259n /   LING -k\u0259n ; February 12, 1809 \u2013 April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman, who served as the 16th  president of the United States , from 1861 until  his assassination  in 1865. Lincoln led the United States through the  American Civil War , defending the nation as a constitutional  union , defeating the insurgent  Confederacy ,  abolishing   slavery , expanding the power of the  federal government , and modernizing the  U.S. economy .Lincoln was born into poverty in a  log cabin  in  Kentucky  and was raised on the  frontier , mainly in  Indiana . He was self-educated and became a lawyer,  Whig Party  leader,  Illinois  state  legislator , and  U.S. representative   from Illinois . In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in  Springfield, Illinois . In 1854, he was angered by the  Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act , which opened the territories to slavery, causing him to re-enter politics. He soon became a leader of the new  Republican Party . He reached a national audience in the  1858 Senate campaign debates  against  Stephen A. Douglas . Lincoln ran for president  in 1860 , sweeping the  North  to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the  South  viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began  seceding from the nation . During this time, the newly formed  Confederate States of America  began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces  attacked Fort Sumter , a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.Lincoln, a  moderate Republican , had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the  Democratic  and Republican parties. His allies, the  War Democrats  and the  Radical Republicans , demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called \" Copperheads \") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His  Gettysburg Address  came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a  naval blockade  of the South's trade. He suspended  habeas corpus  in  Maryland  and  elsewhere , and averted British intervention by defusing the  Trent  Affair . In 1863, he issued the  Emancipation Proclamation , which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons\", and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln pressured  border states  to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the  Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime.Lincoln managed his own successful  re-election campaign . He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the  Confederate surrender at Appomattox , he was attending a play at  Ford's Theatre  in Washington, D.C., with his wife,  Mary , when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer  John Wilkes Booth . Lincoln is remembered as a  martyr  and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often  ranked  in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of  Thomas Lincoln  and  Nancy Hanks Lincoln , in a log cabin on  Sinking Spring Farm  near  Hodgenville, Kentucky . [2]  He was a descendant of  Samuel Lincoln , an Englishman who migrated from  Hingham, Norfolk , to its namesake,  Hingham, Massachusetts , in 1638.

[9]  They had three children:  Sarah , Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant. [10]Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but 200 acres (81 ha) of his land in court disputes over  property titles . [11]  In 1816 the family moved to  Indiana  where the land surveys and titles were more reliable. [12]  Indiana was a  \"free\" (non-slaveholding)  territory, and they settled in an \"unbroken forest\" [13]  in Hurricane Township,  Perry County, Indiana . [14] [d]  In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties. [16]In Kentucky and Indiana Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. [17]  At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a  Separate Baptists  church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery. [18]Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained  clear title  to 80 acres (32 ha) in Indiana, an area which became the  Little Pigeon Creek Community . [19]On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from  milk sickness , leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks. [20]  Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln. [21]On December 2, 1819, Thomas married  Sarah Bush Johnston , a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own. [22]  Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her \"Mother\". [23]  Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. His family even said he was lazy, for all his \"reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.\" [24]  His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy \"physical labor\", but loved to read. [25]Lincoln was largely self-educated. [26]  His formal schooling was from  itinerant teachers . It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read but probably not to write, at age seven, [27]  and in Indiana, where, due to  farm chores, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15. [28]  He remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. [29]  Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the  King James Bible ,  Aesop's Fables ,  John Bunyan 's  The Pilgrim's Progress ,  Daniel Defoe 's  Robinson Crusoe , and  The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin . [30]  Despite being self-educated, Lincoln was the recipient of  honorary degrees  later in life, including an honorary  Doctor of Laws  from  Columbia University  in June 1861. [31]As a teen Lincoln's \"father grew more and more to depend on him for the 'farming, grubbing, hoeing, making fences' necessary to keep the family afloat. He also regularly hired his son out to work ... and by law, he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age\". [32]  Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax. [33]  He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough  catch-as-catch-can  style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21. [34]  He gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the Clary's Grove boys. [35]In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in  Macon County . [36] [e]  Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father's lack of education. [38]  In 1831, as Thomas and other family members prepared to move to a  new homestead  in  Coles County, Illinois , Abraham struck out on his own. [39]  He made his home in  New Salem, Illinois , for six years. [40]  Lincoln and some friends took goods, including live hogs, by  flatboat  to  New Orleans, Louisiana , where he first witnessed slavery. [41]Speculation persists that Lincoln's first romantic interest was  Ann Rutledge , whom he met when he moved to New Salem. Witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two. [42]  Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, most likely of  typhoid fever ; saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave, Lincoln sunk into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her. [43] [44] [45]In the early 1830s he met Mary Owens from Kentucky. [46]  Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied. [47]In 1839 Lincoln met  Mary Todd  in  Springfield, Illinois , and the following year they became engaged. [48]  She was the daughter of  Robert Smith Todd , a wealthy lawyer and businessman in  Lexington, Kentucky . [49]  A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled at Lincoln's request, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's sister. [50]  While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, \"To hell, I suppose.\" [51]  In 1844, the couple bought  a house  in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative. [52]Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The eldest,  Robert Todd Lincoln , was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity.  Edward Baker Lincoln  (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son,  \"Willie\" Lincoln  was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the  White House  on February 20, 1862. The youngest,  Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln , was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871. [53] [f]  Lincoln \"was remarkably fond of children\" [55]  and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own. [56]  In fact, Lincoln's law partner  William H. Herndon  would grow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, \"I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.\" [57]The deaths of their sons Eddie and Willie had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from \" melancholy \", a condition now thought to be  clinical depression . [44]  Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and in 1875 Robert committed her to an asylum. [58]During 1831 and 1832 Lincoln worked at a general store in  New Salem, Illinois . In 1832 he declared his candidacy for the  Illinois House of Representatives , but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the  Illinois Militia  during the  Black Hawk War . [59]  When Lincoln returned home from the  Black Hawk War , he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers single beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the  Lincoln-Berry General Store  became a tavern as well. As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint. They offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. But Berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself. [60]  Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing Lincoln to sell his share.In his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his \"neck and the seat of his trousers\", and tossed him. [36]  In the campaign, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the  Sangamon River . He could draw crowds as a  raconteur , but lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election. [61]  Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct. [62]Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer. [63]  Rather than studying in the office of an established attorney, as was the custom, Lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys  John Todd Stuart  and  Thomas Drummond , purchased books including  Blackstone 's  Commentaries  and  Chitty 's  Pleadings , and  read law  on his own. [63]  He later said of his legal education that \"I studied with nobody.\" [64]Lincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a  Whig , was a success over a powerful Whig opponent. [65]  Then followed his four terms in the  Illinois House of Representatives  for  Sangamon County . [66]  He championed construction of the  Illinois and Michigan Canal , and later was a Canal Commissioner. [67]  He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and  abolition . [68]  In 1837, he declared, \"[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\" [69]  He echoed  Henry Clay 's support for the  American Colonization Society  which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in  Liberia . [70]He was  admitted  to the Illinois bar on September 9, 1836, [71] [72]  and moved to Springfield and began to practice law under  John T. Stuart , Mary Todd's cousin. [73]  Lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered several years with  Stephen T. Logan , and in 1844 began  his practice  with  William Herndon , \"a studious young man\". [74]On January 27, 1838, Abraham Lincoln, then 28 years old, delivered his  first major speech at the Lyceum  in  Springfield, Illinois , after the murder of newspaper editor  Elijah Parish Lovejoy  in Alton. Lincoln warned that no trans-Atlantic military giant could ever crush the US as a nation. \"It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher\", said Lincoln. [75] [76]  Prior to that, on April 28, 1836, an innocent black man,  Francis McIntosh , was burned alive in  St. Louis ,  Missouri . Zann Gill describes how these two murders set off a chain reaction that ultimately prompted Abraham Lincoln to run for President. [77]True to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay\". [78]  Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund  internal improvements  including railroads, and urbanization. [79]In 1843 Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for  Illinois's 7th district seat  in the  U.S. House of Representatives ; he was defeated by  John J. Hardin , though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846, but also won the election. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line. [80]  He was assigned to the  Committee on Post Office and Post Roads  and the  Committee on Expenditures in the War Department . [81]  Lincoln teamed with  Joshua R. Giddings  on a bill to abolish slavery in the  District of Columbia  with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He dropped the bill when it eluded Whig support. [82] [83]On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the  Mexican\u2013American War , which he imputed to President  James K. Polk 's desire for \"military glory \u2014 that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\". [84]  He supported the  Wilmot Proviso , a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico. [85]Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his  Spot Resolutions . The war had begun with a killing of American soldiers by Mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had \"invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil\". [86]  Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil. [87]  The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him \"spotty Lincoln\". [88]  Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers. [89]Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General  Zachary Taylor  for the Whig nomination in the  1848 presidential election . [90]  Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the  United States General Land Office . [91]  The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the  Oregon Territory  as consolation. [92]  This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice. [93]In his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\". [94]  Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years. [95]  Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. [96]  He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in  Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company , a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. [97]  In 1849 he received  a patent for a flotation device  for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent. [98]Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor. [99]  From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the  Illinois Central Railroad . [100]  His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname \"Honest Abe\". [101]Lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial, defending  William \"Duff\" Armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. [102]  The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by  judicial notice  to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a  Farmers' Almanac  showing the Moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted. [102]Leading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case, with his defense of Simeon Quinn \"Peachy\" Harrison who was a third cousin; [g]  Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln's political opponent,  Rev. Peter Cartwright . [104]  Harrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who, as he lay dying of his wounds, confessed to Cartwright that he had provoked Harrison. [105]  Lincoln angrily protested the judge's initial decision to exclude Cartwright's testimony about the confession as inadmissible  hearsay . Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a  dying declaration  and was not subject to the hearsay rule. Instead of holding Lincoln in  contempt of court  as expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in Harrison's acquittal. [102]The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the  Compromise of 1850 , a legislative package designed to address the issue. [106]  In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue. [107]  As the slavery debate in the  Nebraska  and  Kansas  territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed  popular sovereignty  as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's  Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act  narrowly passed Congress in May 1854. [108]Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his \" Peoria Speech \" of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. [109]  He said the Kansas Act had a \" declared  indifference, but as I must think, a covert  real  zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world....\" [110]  Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act marked his return to political life. [111]Nationally the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, \"I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. ... I do no more than oppose the  extension  of slavery.\" [112]  The new  Republican Party  was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining  Free Soil ,  Liberty , and antislavery  Democratic Party  members, [113]  Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists. [114]  Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist  Know Nothing  movement. [115]In 1854 Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath, Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate. [111]  At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. [116]  After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for  Lyman Trumbull . Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate,  Joel Aldrich Matteson . [117]Violent political confrontations in Kansas  continued, and opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the  1856 elections  approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the  Bloomington Convention , which formally established the  Illinois Republican Party . The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the  final speech  of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. [118]  At the June  1856 Republican National Convention , though Lincoln received support to run as vice president,  John C. Fr\u00e9mont  and  William Dayton  were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State  James Buchanan  and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President  Millard Fillmore . [119]  Buchanan prevailed, while Republican  William Henry Bissell  won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois. [120] [h]Dred Scott  was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the  Missouri Compromise . After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in  Dred Scott v. Sandford  (1857). [i]  In his opinion, Supreme Court Chief Justice  Roger B. Taney  wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' \"property\" rights. While many Democrats hoped that  Dred Scott  would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North. [123]  Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the  Slave Power . [124]  He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal \"in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". [125]In 1858 Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor. [126]  Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the  Lecompton Constitution  and admission of Kansas as a  slave state . [127]  Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition. [128]Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his  House Divided Speech , with the biblical reference  Mark 3:25 , \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved\u2014I do not expect the house to fall\u2014but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\" [129]  The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion. [130]  The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas. [131]  When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, \"[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party ... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.\" [132]The Senate campaign featured seven  debates  between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands. [133]  The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that the  Slave Power  was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that  all men are created equal . In his  Freeport Doctrine , Douglas argued that, despite the  Dred Scott  decision, which he claimed to support, [134]  local settlers, under the doctrine of  popular sovereignty , should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and he accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. [135]  Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal in nature, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court as exercised in the  Dred Scott  decision. [136]Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln's articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence. [137]  In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the  Illinois Staats-Anzeiger , a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted for Democrats, but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support. [138]  In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by  William H. Seward ,  Salmon P. Chase ,  Edward Bates , and  Simon Cameron . While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office. [139]  In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy. [140]Over the coming months Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the  Midwestern United States , he was less appreciated in the east.  Horace Greeley , editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's  Dred Scott  ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals. [141] [142]On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a  speech at Cooper Union , in which he argued that the  Founding Fathers of the United States  had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any \"groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong\". [143]  Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly. [144]  But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention. Journalist  Noah Brooks  reported, \"No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience\". [145]Historian  David Herbert Donald  described the speech as \"a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. Appearing in Seward's home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase, Lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination.\" [146]  In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, \"The taste  is  in my mouth a little\". [147]On May 9\u201310, 1860 the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. [148]  Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by  David Davis ,  Norman Judd ,  Leonard Swett , and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. [149]  Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". [150]  In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" [151]  Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. [152]On May 18 at the  Republican National Convention  in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat,  Hannibal Hamlin  of Maine, was nominated for vice president to  balance the ticket . Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. [153]  Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. [154]  Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". [155]As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. [156]  When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the  Democratic convention ; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President  John C. Breckinridge  as their candidate. [157]  A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the  Constitutional Union Party  and nominated  John Bell  of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South. [126]Before the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the  Wide Awakes , which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. [158]  People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln. [159]As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. [160]  The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a  Chicago Tribune  writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000\u2013200,000 copies. [161]  Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired  John George Nicolay  as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency. [162]On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. [163] [164]  Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. [165]  His victory in the  Electoral College  was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents. [166]The South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861. [168]  On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. [169]  Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the  Confederate States of America , and adopted a constitution. [170]  The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal. [171]  President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. [172]  The Confederacy selected  Jefferson Davis  as its provisional president on February 9, 1861. [173]Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed  Crittenden Compromise  as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the  territories . [174]  Lincoln said, \"I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right\". [175]Lincoln supported the  Corwin Amendment  to the Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed. [176]  On March 4, 1861, in his  first inaugural address , Lincoln said that, because he holds \"such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable\". [177]  A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. [178]On February 11, 1861 Lincoln gave a particularly emotional  farewell address  upon leaving Springfield; he would never again return to Springfield alive. [179] [180]  Lincoln traveled east in a special train. Due to secessionist plots, a then-unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train. En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. [181]  The president-elect evaded suspected  assassins in Baltimore . On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. [182]  Lincoln directed  his inaugural address  to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states:Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating \"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.\" The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" [185]  The failure of the  Peace Conference of 1861  signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. [186]  In his  second inaugural address , Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: \"Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\"Major Robert Anderson , commander of the Union's  Fort Sumter  in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops  at Fort Sumter  and began the fight. Historian  Allan Nevins  argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking  Southern Unionist  opposition to an invasion. [187]William Tecumseh Sherman  talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the South was preparing for war. [188]  Donald concludes, \"His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Fort Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he had also vowed not to surrender the forts.... The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the Confederates to fire the first shot\". They did just that. [189]On April 15 Lincoln called on the states to send a total of  75,000 volunteer troops  to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of  Richmond  as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral. [190]  The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the  Mason-Dixon line  to defend the nation.As states sent Union regiments south, on April 19 Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links  attacked Union troops  who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting  local Maryland  officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of  habeas corpus  in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach Washington. [191]   John Merryman , one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of  habeas corpus.  In June, in  Ex parte Merryman , Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court, [192]  issued the writ, believing that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it. But Lincoln invoked  nonacquiescence  and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas. [193] [194]Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the  Union  military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as  commander-in-chief  by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended  habeas corpus , and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict. [195]It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. [196]  On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the  Confiscation Act , which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery. [197]In August 1861 General John C. Fr\u00e9mont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity. [198]  As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000. [199]Internationally Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy. [200]  He relied on his combative Secretary of State  William Seward  while working closely with  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  chairman  Charles Sumner . [201]  In the 1861  Trent Affair , which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the  Trent , on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer  James G. Randall  dissected Lincoln's successful techniques: [202]his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced  War Secretary  Simon Cameron with  Edwin Stanton . Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000. [203]  Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than did any other senior official. \"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together\", say Thomas and Hyman. [204]Lincoln's war strategy had two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory. [j]  Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard. [206]  For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General  Henry Halleck  entitled  Elements of Military Art and Science ; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist  Antoine-Henri Jomini . Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the  Mississippi River . [207]  Lincoln saw the importance of  Vicksburg  and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than merely capturing territory. [208]In directing the Union's war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of  Gen. Winfield Scott , even after his retirement as  Commanding General of the United States Army . On June 23\u201324, 1862, Lincoln made an unannounced visit to  West Point , where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the  War Department . [209] [210]After the Union rout at  Bull Run  and  Winfield Scott 's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General  George B. McClellan  general-in-chief. [211]  McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia  Peninsula Campaign . McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital. [212]In 1862 Lincoln removed McClellan for the general's continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed  John Pope  as head of the new  Army of Virginia . [213]  Pope satisfied Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thus protecting Washington from counterattack. [214]  But Pope was then soundly defeated at the  Second Battle of Bull Run  in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington. [215]Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington. [216]  Two days after McClellan's return to command, General  Robert E. Lee 's forces crossed the  Potomac River  into Maryland, leading to the  Battle of Antietam . [217]  That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation  in January. [218]McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while General  Don Carlos Buell  likewise refused orders to move the  Army of the Ohio  against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with  William Rosecrans ; and after the  1862 midterm elections  he replaced McClellan with  Ambrose Burnside . The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part. [219]Against presidential advice Burnside launched an offensive across the  Rappahannock River  and was  defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg  in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with  Joseph Hooker . [220]In the 1862 midterm elections the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of  habeas corpus ,  military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations. [221]In the spring of 1863 Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga,  Grant  on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston. [222]Hooker was routed by Lee at the  Battle of Chancellorsville  in May, then resigned and was replaced by  George Meade . [223]  Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the  Gettysburg Campaign , but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states. [224]The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states. Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. He sought to persuade the states to agree to  compensation  for emancipating their slaves. [225]  Lincoln rejected Major General  John C. Fr\u00e9mont 's August 1861  emancipation  attempt, as well as one by Major General  David Hunter  in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede. [226]In June 1862 Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the  Confiscation Act of 1862  was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. [227]Peace Democrats (Copperheads) argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification, but Republican editor  Horace Greeley  of the  New-York Tribune , in his public letter, \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions\", implored Lincoln to embrace emancipation. [228] [229]  In a public letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln replied to Greeley, writing that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union: [230]My paramount object in this struggle  is  to save the Union, and is  not  either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing  any  slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing  all  the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do  not  believe it would help to save the Union ... [\u00b6] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of  official  duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed  personal  wish that all men everywhere could be free. [231]When Lincoln published his reply to Greeley, he had already decided to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and therefore had already chosen the third option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: to free some of the slaves, namely those in the states in rebellion. Some scholars, therefore, believe that his reply to Greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the Union. [232]  On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, [233]  which announced that, in states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, the slaves would be freed. He spent the next 100 days, between September 22 and January 1, preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites. [234]  At the same time, during those 100 days, Lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact, suggesting that he still took seriously the first option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: saving the Union without freeing any slave. [235]  But, on January 1, 1863, keeping his word, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, [236]  freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, [237]  with exemptions specified for areas under such control. [238]  Lincoln's comment on signing the Proclamation was: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\" [239]With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south \"enable[d] thousands of slaves to escape to freedom\". [240]  The Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be \"received into the armed service of the United States,\" enlisting these freedmen became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor  Andrew Johnson  encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, \"The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once\". [241]  By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General  Lorenzo Thomas  \"had enrolled twenty regiments of African Americans\" from the Mississippi Valley. [241]Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. [244]  In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\". He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\". [245]Defying his prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history. [246]General Ulysses Grant's  victories at the  Battle of Shiloh  and in the  Vicksburg campaign  impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can't spare this man. He fights.\" [247]  With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade's army. [248]Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since  George Washington . [249]  Authorization for such a promotion \"with the advice and consent of the Senate\" was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant's name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864. [250]Grant in 1864 waged the bloody  Overland Campaign , which exacted heavy losses on both sides. [251]  When Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the persistent general replied, \"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" [252]  Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at  City Point, Virginia , to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. [253]  Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North. [254]  Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure\u2014plantations, railroads, and bridges\u2014hoping to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake. [255]  Lincoln's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general  Jubal Early   raided Washington, D.C.  Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future  Supreme Court Justice )  Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.  shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\" But this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal. [256] [257] [258] [259]As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President  Stephens  led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at  Hampton Roads . Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized. [260]  On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox , officially ending the war. [261]Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with  War Democrats   Edwin M. Stanton  and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers\u2014greatly expanded from peacetime\u2014to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him. [262]  At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new  Union Party . [263]Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House; [264]  Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows:This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward. [265]The Democratic platform followed the \"Peace wing\" of the party and called the war a \"failure\"; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and  David Farragut 's capture of Mobile ended defeatism. [266]  The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the  perfidy  of the Copperheads. [267]  On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers. [268]On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his  second inaugural address . In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God's will. Historian  Mark Noll  places the speech \"among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;\" it is inscribed in the  Lincoln Memorial . [269]  Lincoln said:Fondly do we hope\u2014fervently do we pray\u2014that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the  bond-man's  two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether\". With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan\u2014to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations. [270]Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\" [271]  Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one. [272]  Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep.  Thaddeus Stevens , Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen.  Benjamin Wade , who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His  Amnesty Proclamation  of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance. [273]As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and  Frederick Steele  as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General  Nathaniel P. Banks  to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864  Wade\u2013Davis Bill , which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee. [274]Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies. [275]After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole matter\" and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress. [276]  The Senate passed it on April 8, 1864, but the first vote in the House of Representatives fell short of the required two-thirds majority. Passage became part of Lincoln's reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865. [277]  With ratification, it became the  Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  on December 6, 1865. [278]Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's  Freedmen's Bureau  bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists. [279]Historians agree that it is impossible to predict how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and  Richard Current , according to David Lincove, argue that: [280]It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.Eric Foner  argues that: [281]Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans. ... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves ... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.Lincoln's experience with Native Americans started early with their killing of his grandfather in front of his family. [282]  Later he served as a captain in the  state militia  during the  Black Hawk War  but saw no combat. [283]  Lincoln used appointments to the  Indian Bureau  as a reward to supporters from  Minnesota  and  Wisconsin . While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks. [284]On August 17, 1862, the  Dakota War  broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed, 30,000 were displaced from their homes, and Washington was deeply alarmed. [285]  Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier. [286]  Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising. [287]  When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in Minnesota. Lincoln sent General  John Pope  as commander of the new  Department of the Northwest  two weeks into the hostilities. [288] [289]  Before he arrived, the  Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa  sent Lincoln a letter asking to go to war for the United States against the Sioux, so Lincoln could send Minnesota's troops to fight the South. [290] [291]  Shortly after, a  Mille Lacs Band  Chief offered the same at  St. Cloud, Minnesota . [292] [293]  In it the Chippewa specified they wanted to use the indigenous  rules of warfare . [294]  That meant there would be no  prisoners of war , no  surrender , no  peace agreement . [295]  Lincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer, as he could not control the Chippewa, and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare. [296]Serving under Gen. Pope was Minnesota Congressman  Henry H. Sibley . Minnesota's Governor had made Sibley a Colonel  United States Volunteers  to command the US force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated  Little Crow 's forces at the  Battle of Wood Lake . [289] \nThe day the Mdewakanton force  surrendered at Camp Release , a Chippewa war council met at  Minnesota's capitol  with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln, to fight the Sioux. [297] [ additional citation(s) needed ]  Sibley ordered a  military commission  to review the actions of the captured, to try those that had committed  war crimes . The legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the  Mexican War . [298]  Sibley thought he had 16-20 of the men he wanted for trial, while Gen. Pope ordered all detained be tried. 303 were given death sentences that were subject to Presidential review. Lincoln ordered Pope send all trial transcripts to Washington, where Lincoln and two of his staff examined them. Lincoln realized the trials could be divided into two groups: combat between combatants and combat against civilians. [ citation needed ]  The groups could be identified by their transcripts, the first group all had three pages in length while the second group had more, some up to twelve pages. [ citation needed ]  He placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences. In the second group were forty cases. One he commuted for becoming a  state's witness . Sibley dismissed another when proof surfaced exonerating the defendant. The remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass hanging in U.S. history. [ citation needed ]  Questions arose concerning three executions that have not been answered. [299]  Less than 4 months afterwards, Lincoln issued the  Lieber Code , which governed wartime conduct of the Union Army, by defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Congressman  Alexander Ramsey  told Lincoln in 1864, he would have gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton. Lincoln responded, \"I could not afford to hang men for votes.\" [300]  The men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at  Davenport, Iowa . Some he released due to the efforts of Bishop  Henry Whipple .Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating. Lincoln vetoed only four bills, including the  Wade-Davis Bill  with its harsh Reconstruction program. [301]  The  1862 Homestead Act  made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862  Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act  provided government grants for  agricultural colleges  in each state. The  Pacific Railway Acts  of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States'  first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 1869. [302]  The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s. [303]In the selection and use of his cabinet Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, \"We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.\" [305]  Goodwin described the group in her biography as a  Team of Rivals . [306]There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a  Federal income tax . In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third  Morrill Tariffs , following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the  Revenue Act of 1861 , creating the first U.S. income tax\u2014a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (equivalent to $26,056 in 2022 [307] ). [308]  The  Revenue Act of 1862  adopted rates that increased with income. [309]The Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The  National Banking Act  created the system of national banks. The US issued paper currency for the first time, known as  greenbacks \u2014printed in green on the reverse side. [310]  In 1862, Congress created the  Department of Agriculture . [308]In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the  New York World  and the  Journal of Commerce  published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days. [311]Lincoln is largely responsible for the  Thanksgiving holiday . [312]  Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during  James Madison 's presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. [312]In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as  Yosemite National Park . [313]Lincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\" [312]  Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court.  Noah Haynes Swayne  was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union.  Samuel Freeman Miller  supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat  Stephen Johnson Field , a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party. [314]Lincoln named his main political rival, William H. Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio. However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy. [315]  He also closely watched the handling of the  Trent Affair  in late 1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with Britain. [316]  Seward's main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy. He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South. [317]John Wilkes Booth  was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. [318]  After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically \"on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers\", [319]  Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President. [320]  When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at  Ford's Theatre . Lincoln and his wife attended the play  Our American Cousin  on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the  Battle of Appomattox Courthouse . At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play. [321]At 10:15 in the evening Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln's guest, Major  Henry Rathbone , momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. [322]  After being attended by  Doctor Charles Leale  and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to  Petersen House . After remaining in a  coma  for eight hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 in the morning on April 15. [323] [k]  Stanton saluted and said, \"Now he belongs to the ages.\" [328] [l]  Lincoln's body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin, which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers. [329]  President Johnson was sworn in later that same day. [330]Two weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia. He was mortally shot by Sergeant  Boston Corbett  and died on April 26. Secretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken alive, so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed. After a brief interview, Stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge. [331]The late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 to 21. The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the  Lincoln Special   funeral train . [332]  The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing [333]  or in silent grief. Poet  Walt Whitman  composed \" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd \" to eulogize him, one of  four poems he wrote about Lincoln . [334]  African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \" Moses \". [335]  In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war. [336]  Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death. [337]  Lincoln's body was buried at  Oak Ridge Cemetery  in Springfield and now lies within the  Lincoln Tomb . [338]As a young man Lincoln was a  religious skeptic . [339]  He was deeply familiar with the  Bible , quoting and praising it. [340]  He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others. [341]  He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. [342]  Throughout his public career, Lincoln often quoted Scripture. [343]  His three most famous speeches\u2014 the House Divided Speech ,  the Gettysburg Address , and  his second inaugural \u2014each contain direct allusions to Providence and quotes from Scripture.In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the  Doctrine of Necessity , a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power. [344]  With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God. [345]  He never joined a church, although he frequently attended  First Presbyterian Church  with his wife beginning in 1852. [346] [m]In the 1850s Lincoln asserted his belief in \"providence\" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. [347]  The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace. [348]  After Willie's death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war's severity. He wrote at this time that God \"could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\" [349]Lincoln did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches. [342]  By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky:I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God. [350]This spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars [351]  as the greatest such address in American history, and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least. [n] [352]  Lincoln explains therein that the cause, purpose, and result of the war was God's will. [353]  Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly  evangelical   Protestants . [354]  On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the  Holy Land . [355]Lincoln is believed to have had depression,  smallpox , and  malaria . [356]  He took  blue mass  pills, which contained  mercury , [357]  to treat  constipation . [358]  It is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in  mercury poisoning . [359]Several claims have been made that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on  photographs of Lincoln  appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. [360]  It is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as  Marfan syndrome  or  multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B . [360]Lincoln's redefinition of  republican values  has been stressed by historians such as  John Patrick Diggins ,  Harry V. Jaffa ,  Vernon Burton , Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz. [361]  Lincoln called the  Declaration of Independence \u2014which emphasized freedom and equality for all\u2014the \" sheet anchor \" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the  Constitution , which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse. [362]  Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech. [363]  Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism. [364]His position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state. [365]  Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs. [366]As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to  Jacksonian democrats . [367]  Lincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the Jacksonian view that  the government should be divorced from economic enterprise . [368]  Nevertheless, Lincoln admired  Andrew Jackson 's steeliness as well as his patriotism. [369]  According to historian  Sean Wilentz : [369]Just as the Republican Party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of Jacksonianism, so Lincoln, whose Whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other Whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well. And some of the Jacksonian spirit resided inside the Lincoln White House.William C. Harris  found that Lincoln's \"reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.\" [370]  James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.\" Randall concludes that \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\" [371]In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said, \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\" [372]The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. The term \"the United States\" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (\"these United States\") and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century. [373]In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color. [374]In  surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents  conducted since 1948, the top three presidents are generally Lincoln, Washington, and  Franklin Delano Roosevelt , although the order varies. [375] [o]  Between 1999 and 2011, Lincoln,  John F. Kennedy , and  Ronald Reagan  were the top-ranked presidents in eight  public opinion  surveys, according to Gallup. [377]  A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington. [378]Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. [379]  Historians have said he was \"a  classical liberal \" in the 19th-century sense.  Allen C. Guelzo  states that Lincoln was a \"classical liberal democrat\u2014an enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to  Mill ,  Cobden , and  Bright \", whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office. [380] [381]Sociologist  Barry Schwartz  argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the  Progressive Era  (1900\u20131920s), when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the  Lincoln Memorial  on the  National Mall  in Washington, D.C. [382]Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, \"helped lead America to the nationalism of  Theodore Roosevelt ,  Woodrow Wilson , and  Franklin Delano Roosevelt .\" [383]  In the  New Deal  era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the  self-made man  or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the  welfare state . [384]Schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with \"a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.\" During the  Great Depression , he argues, Lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.\" Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\" [385]  However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.\" He suggested that  postmodernism  and  multiculturalism  have diluted greatness as a concept. [386]In the  Cold War  years Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by  Communist regimes . [384]  He had long been known as the Great Emancipator, [387]  but, by the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by  Lerone Bennett Jr. , denied that Lincoln deserved that title. [388] [389]  Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a  white supremacist  in 1968. [390]  He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them. [391]  Defenders of Lincoln, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day [392]  and that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. [393]  Dirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett seriously, pointing to his \"narrow political agenda and faulty research\". [394]By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to  political conservatives [395] \u2014apart from  neo-Confederates  such as  Mel Bradford , who denounced his treatment of the white South\u2014for his intense nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, his acting on  Lockean  and  Burkean  principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. [396]  Lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world. [397]Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered \"erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule\" in the late 20th century. [398]  On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of  negative capability , defined by the poet  John Keats  and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were \"content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason\". [399]In the 21st century President  Barack Obama  named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the  Lincoln Bible  for his inaugural ceremonies. [400] [401] [402]Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light. [403] [404]Lincoln has been also admired by political figures outside the U.S.,  including German political theorist   Karl Marx , [405]  Indian  independence  leader  Mahatma Gandhi , [406]  former  Liberian  president  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , [407]  leader of the Italian  Risorgimento ,  Giuseppe Garibaldi , [408]  and Libyan revolutionary  Muammar Gaddafi . [409]Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of  United States currency , the  penny  and the  $5 bill . His likeness also appears on many  postage stamps . [410]  While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old  Grace Bedell . He was the first of five presidents to do so. [411]He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, [412]  including the  capital  of Nebraska. [413]  The  United States Navy   Nimitz -class aircraft carrier   USS  Abraham Lincoln   (CVN-72)  is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name. [414]  The  Lincoln Memorial  is one of the most visited monuments in the nation's capital [415]  and is one of the top five most visited  National Park Service  sites in the country. [416]  Ford's Theatre, among the most visited sites in Washington, D.C., [416]  is across the street from  Petersen House , where Lincoln died. [417]  Memorials in Springfield, Illinois, include the  Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum ,  Lincoln's home , and  his tomb . [418]  A portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on  Mount Rushmore , which receives about 3 million visitors a year. [419]  An  influential statue of Lincoln  stands in  Lincoln Park , Chicago, with recastings given as diplomatic gifts standing in  Parliament Square , London, and  Parque Lincoln , Mexico City. [420] [421] [422]In 2019 Congress officially dedicated room H-226 in the  United States Capitol  to Abraham Lincoln. [423]  The room is located off  National Statuary Hall  and served as the  post office  of the House while then-Representative Abraham Lincoln served in Congress from 1847 to 1849. [424] [425].",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Adam Jameson  (5 May 1860 \u2013 12 March 1907) was a Scottish-born  physician  who was a member of parliament and government minister in both the Australian state of  Western Australia  and the  Transvaal Colony  (in present-day South Africa).Jameson was born in  Pathhead ,  Fife , Scotland, where his father, Charles Adam Jameson, was a  Church of Scotland  minister. He attended Craigmount School, Edinburgh, before going on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating M.B., C.M. in 1883. After a brief period at Chalmers Hospital, Banff, Jameson left for Western Australia, arriving in 1884. In 1889, he married Ethel Mary Hensman, the daughter of Alfred Hensman (a former Attorney-General of Western Australia). [1]  Jameson left for Europe in 1893, on a health trip, and lived in  Rome  until his wife's death in 1897. That same year he received his medical degree from the University of Edinburgh, [2]  and then returned to Australia. [1]Jameson first attempted to enter politics at the  1890 general election , the first to be held for the  Legislative Assembly . He was defeated by  William Silas Pearse  in the  seat of North Fremantle . [3]  In 1899, Jameson was appointed chairman of a  royal commission  into the prisons system in Western Australia. He was elected to parliament at the 1900 Legislative Council elections, as one of three members for the newly created  Metropolitan-Suburban Province . In  George Leake 's first government, which lasted from June to November 1901, Jameson served as a  minister without portfolio . When Leake returned as  premier  in December 1901, he was made  Minister for Lands . He remained in the position under  Walter James  (who became premier in July 1902 following Leake's death in office), but resigned from both parliament and the ministry in January 1903 in order to go to South Africa. [1]The  Governor of Western Australia  from 1901 to 1902 was Sir  Arthur Lawley , who left office when he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal. In late 1902, Lawley offered Jameson the position of Commissioner of Lands in his government, which would also make him an  ex officio  member of the Transvaal Legislative Council. [4]  Jameson accepted the position, which he took up the following year. Outside of his friendship with Lawley, he also had another connection with South Africa \u2013 his second cousin,  Leander Starr Jameson , was a Prime Minister of the  Cape Colony . [5]  Jameson served in the ministry until early 1907, when  responsible government  was implemented, and received a substantial pension after his retirement. [6]After leaving South Africa, Jameson intended to take a brief trip to London, and then to retire to  Cairo . He left  Pretoria  in March 1907, taking an overnight train to  Louren\u00e7o Marques ,  Mozambique . However, recent heavy rainfall had washed away a  culvert  on the line near  Alkmaar , and caused the train to derail. Jameson and eleven others were killed in the accident. [5]  He was survived by his three daughters, living in London, and a sister, who was married to  John Foulkes  (an MP in Western Australia). [7].",

Serving in two governments, he held portfolios related to lands and agriculture, contributing to policy-making and reform.\n\nHowever, it was perhaps in his poetry that Jameson found a way to express his deepest emotions and observations. \"bottle rockets,\" published in his collection Small Town, captures the essence of a summer night's celebration with vivid imagery and sensory details.

Through his poetic lens, Jameson invites readers to appreciate the fleeting beauty in life and the memories that endure long after the sparks have faded.\n\nJameson's life took an unexpected turn when he accepted the position of Commissioner of Lands in the Transvaal Colony, serving under Governor Sir Arthur Lawley. This appointment was likely influenced by his connection to South Africa through his second cousin, Leander Starr Jameson, who was a Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. In this new role, Jameson contributed to the administration of the colony and became an ex officio member of the Transvaal Legislative Council.\n\nUnfortunately, Jameson's life was cut short in a tragic train accident in March 1907. He had planned to retire to Cairo but met his untimely end on an overnight train to Louren\u00e7o Marques, Mozambique, due to a washed-out culvert on the line.\n\nAdam Jameson's legacy lies not only in his political contributions but also in his poetic works. His poetry, though sparse, captures moments of beauty and emotion, offering readers a unique perspective on life's fleeting nature. Through his words, Jameson continues to illuminate the world with the brilliance of tiny suns, reminding us to cherish life's fleeting moments and the enduring power of memory.\n\nToday, Jameson's poetry resonates with readers who find solace and joy in the simple pleasures he so skillfully captures. His work serves as a reminder to slow down and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us, even in the most ordinary of moments. Whether it's the splendor of fireworks on a summer night or the quiet beauty of a sunset, Adam Jameson's poetry invites us to embrace life's transient nature and create lasting memories.",
        "reflected_response": "\nResponse:\nAdam Jameson was a man of many talents and passions. A physician and politician by trade, he also had a deep appreciation for the arts, as evidenced by his poetry. Born in Scotland, he embarked on a journey to Western Australia where he established himself in both medicine and politics. He served in two governments, holding portfolios related to lands and agriculture, and contributed to policy-making and reform. However, it was in his poetry that Jameson truly expressed himself, capturing moments of beauty and emotion. His poem, \"bottle rockets,\" published in his collection Small Town, is a vivid depiction of a summer night's celebration, transforming a commonplace event into a dazzling display. Unfortunately, Jameson's promising life was cut short in a tragic train accident in 1907, but his legacy lives on through his political contributions and poetic works, reminding us to cherish life's fleeting moments."

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Born in Birkenhead, England, Adrian Henri was a painter and poet. His highly visual poetry reflects his strong foundation in fine art, which he established during his time at King&rsquo;s College, where he studied painting. He was greatly influenced by abstract impressionism and the newly emergent pop art of the 1960s, incorporating these styles into his paintings of urban life. His poetry mirrored his art, in both style and content, and he often alluded to his visual art within his verse.  &nbsp; Henri was a member of the Liverpool poetry scene, and his work was first introduced to the public in the notable anthology Penguin Modern Poets 10 (1967), alongside that of contemporaries Roger McGough and Brian Patten. Together, these poets revived the concept of performance poetry, drawing inspiration from unpretentious urban subjects while adapting modern pop art styles of expression into exuberant readings. Henri continued painting and performing and writing poetry well into the 1990s, expanding the oeuvre to include children&rsquo;s poetry, television drama, and plays. In the late 1990s, he suffered a stroke that severely impaired his ability to speak; however, after relearning how to talk and paint, he continued to produce art and verse until his death in 2000., Adrian Henri  (10 April 1932 \u2013 20 December 2000) was a British  poet  and painter [1]  best remembered as the founder of poetry-rock group the Liverpool Scene and as one of three poets in the best-selling anthology  The Mersey Sound , along with  Brian Patten  and  Roger McGough . The trio of  Liverpool poets  came to prominence in that city's  Merseybeat   zeitgeist  of the 1960s and 1970s. He was described by  Edward Lucie-Smith  in  British Poetry since 1945  as the \"theoretician\" of the three. His characterisation of popular culture in verse helped to widen the audience for poetry among 1960s British youth. He was influenced by the French  Symbolist  school of poetry and  surrealist  art.Adrian Henri's grandfather was a seaman from  Mauritius  who settled in  Birkenhead ,  Cheshire , where Henri was born. In 1938, at the age of six, he moved to  Rhyl . [2]  He studied art at  Newcastle  and for a short time taught art at  Preston Catholic College  before going on to lecture in art at both  Manchester  and Liverpool Colleges of Art. He was closely associated with other artists of the area and the era including the Pop artist  Neville Weston  and the conceptual artist  Keith Arnatt . In 1972 he won a major prize for his painting  Meat Painting II \u2013 In Memoriam Rene Magritte  in the  John Moores  competition. He was president of the Merseyside Arts Association and Liverpool Academy of the Arts in the 1970s and was an honorary professor of the city's  John Moores University .Henri had a 10-year relationship with  Carol Ann Duffy , who later became  Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom . The pair met when she was 16, him 39 at the time, and lived together until 1982. [3]  Henri married once, to Joyce; the couple later separated. He had no children. For the last 15 years of his life his partner was Catherine Marcangeli. [4]  His career spanned everything from artist and poet to teacher, rock-and-roll performer, playwright and librettist. He could name among his friends  John Lennon ,  George Melly ,  Allen Ginsberg ,  Willy Russell ,  John Willett  and  Paul McCartney . Unlike McGough and Patten, Henri turned his back on the trendier London scene, and chose to remain in Liverpool, saying there was nowhere he loved better.His numerous publications include  The Mersey Sound  (Penguin, 1967), with McGough and Patten, a best-selling poetry anthology that brought all three of them to wider attention,  Collected Poems, 1967\u201385  ( Allison & Busby , 1986),  Wish You Were Here  ( Jonathan Cape , 1990) and  Not Fade Away  ( Bloodaxe Books , 1994).He was the leading light of a band, the Liverpool Scene, which released four LPs of poetry and music. Earlier, in 1955, he played washboard in the King's College, Newcastle, Skiffle Group. He was a firm believer in live poetry reading, and read his poetry at many and varied venues as well as holding poetry workshops at schools and colleges. One of his last major poetry readings was at the launch of  The Argotist  magazine in 1996.In 1986 Henri became the first President of the National Acrylic Painters' Association, a post he held until 1991, after which he became its first Fellow and Patron until his death in 2000.He died in Liverpool, aged 68, having never properly recovered from a stroke that he had suffered two years previously. The night before his death,  Liverpool City Council  conferred on him the Freedom of the City in recognition of his contribution to Liverpool's cultural scene. [4]  He also received an honorary doctorate from the  University of Liverpool .He described his early philosophy as \"If you think you can do it and you want to do it\u2014then do it.\"In 2012  Adrian Henri: Total Artist  was released.  Total Artist  concentrates on Henri's work from the 1960s and 1970s, as well as capturing some of the excitement and dynamics of the art scene in Britain during this time. Henri was at the centre of a distinctive yet highly connected counter-culture, providing an opportunity to consider his embrace of total art as a template for interdisciplinary art practice. Published by Occasional Papers, the Exhibition Research Centre, Liverpool John Moores University and Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot.The Liverpool Scene was a poetry band, formed around 1967, which included Adrian Henri,  Andy Roberts , Mike Evans,  Mike Hart  (ex  Liverpool Roadrunners ), [2]   Percy Jones  and Brian Dodson. Four LPs were issued with Henri's poetry heavily featured. The first one was produced by Liverpool DJ  John Peel , who was then working on the pirate radio station  Radio London . Despite his support, the album achieved little success: the following three were equally unsuccessful. Public performances by the band included a (financially unsuccessful) 1969 tour [2]  when they opened for  Led Zeppelin . Henri was described in performance as \"bouncing thunderously and at risk to audience and fellow performers, the stage vibrating out of rhythm beneath him.\" The Liverpool Scene disbanded in April 1970.

        "reflected_response": " Early Life and Education: \nEmily Elizabeth Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was a lawyer and treasurer at Amherst College, and her mother, Emily Norcross Dickinson, was a deeply religious homemaker. Dickinson grew up in a supportive and nurturing environment with her two younger siblings, Lavinia and William. She received a traditional education for a young woman of her era, first at Amherst Academy and later at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary. Despite her relatively brief formal education, she was an avid reader and had a deep passion for literature and poetry.\n\nCareer:\nDickinson's poetic career began in earnest around 1858 when she started actively composing and compiling her poems. However, most of her work remained unknown beyond her close circle of friends and family during her lifetime. She was notoriously reclusive, rarely venturing beyond her family estate, and preferred to communicate through letters, which she often accompanied with handmade pressed flower arrangements. This habit earned her the nickname of \"The Mythic Recluse\" by one of her correspondents. Dickinson's poetry is known for its innovative use of form and punctuation, as well as its exploration of themes such as nature, mortality, and spirituality. She often wrote in short, concise lines, creating a distinctive style that set her apart from her contemporaries.\n\nPersonal Life:\nDickinson's personal life has long been a subject of speculation and intrigue. She never married and had very few documented romantic relationships. Her closest relationship was with Susan Gilbert, whom she referred to as her \"dear friend and sister\". They exchanged numerous letters, and Susan later married Dickinson's brother, Austin. Dickinson also had a close friendship with Judge Otis Phillips Lord, who may have been a potential romantic interest. However, the exact nature of their relationship remains unclear.\n\nDeath and Legacy:\nDickinson died on May 15, 1886, at the age of 55, likely from Bright's disease, a kidney disorder. At the time of her death, only a small handful of her poems had been published, and she left behind a collection of nearly 1800 poems, most of which were unpublished. It was only after her sister, Lavinia, discovered this vast treasure trove of poetry that the world began to appreciate the brilliance and uniqueness of Dickinson's work. Today, she is widely considered one of the most important and influential American poets, renowned for her bold experimentation with form and her profound exploration of the human condition. Her poetry continues to inspire and captivate readers, offering a window into the soul of a complex and enigmatic woman. \n\nHere lies the story of Emily Elizabeth Dickinson, a legendary poet whose words echo across generations, forever etched in the annals of literary history. \n\nMay her verses continue to resonate,\nCaptivating minds and stirring hearts,\nHer legacy forever alive,\nIn the realms of poetic mastery. \n"

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Adrian Mitchell   FRSL  (24 October 1932 \u2013 20 December 2008) [1]  was an English poet, novelist and playwright. A former journalist, he became a noted figure on the British  Left . For almost half a century he was the foremost poet of the country's  Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  movement. The critic  Kenneth Tynan  called him \"the British  Mayakovsky \". [2]Mitchell sought in his work to counteract the implications of his own assertion, that \"Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people.\" [3]In a  National Poetry Day  poll in 2005, his poem \"Human Beings\" was voted the one most people would like to see launched into space. [4]  In 2002, he was nominated, semi-seriously, as Britain's \"Shadow  Poet Laureate \". [5]  Mitchell was for some years poetry editor of the  New Statesman , and was the first to publish an interview with  the Beatles . [6]  His work for the  Royal Shakespeare Company  included  Peter Brook 's  US  and the English version of  Peter Weiss 's  Marat/Sade . [1]Ever inspired by the example of his own favourite poet and precursor  William Blake , about whom he wrote the acclaimed  Tyger  for the  National Theatre , Mitchell's often angry output swirled from  anarchistic   anti-war  satire, through  love poetry  to, increasingly, stories and poems for children. He also wrote  librettos . The Poetry Archive identified his creative yield as hugely prolific. [7]The Times  said that Mitchell's had been a \"forthright voice often laced with tenderness\". His poems on such topics as  nuclear war ,  Vietnam , prisons and racism had become \"part of the folklore of the Left. His work was often read and sung at  demonstrations and rallies \". [8]Adrian Mitchell was born near  Hampstead Heath , north London. His mother, Kathleen Fabian, was a  Fr\u00f6bel -trained nursery school teacher and his father, Jock Mitchell, a research chemist from  Cupar  in Fife. Adrian was educated at the Junior School of  Monkton Combe School  in  Bath . He then went to  Greenways School , at  Ashton Gifford House  in Wiltshire, run at the time by a friend of his mother. This, said Mitchell, was \"a school in Heaven, where my first play,  The Animals' Brains Trust , was staged when I was nine to my great satisfaction.\" [9]His schooling was completed as a boarder at  Dauntsey's School , where he collaborated in plays with friend  Gordon Snell . [10]  Mitchell did his  National Service  in the  RAF . He commented that this \"confirmed (his) natural pacificism\". [9]  He went on to study English at  Christ Church, Oxford , where he was taught by  J. R. R. Tolkien 's son. Mitchell became chairman of the university's poetry society and the literary editor of  Isis  magazine . [11]  On graduating, he got a job as a reporter on the  Oxford Mail  and, later, at the  Evening Standard  in London. [3]  He later wrote of this period:Inheriting enough money to live on for a year, I wrote my first novel and my first TV play. Soon afterwards I became a freelance journalist, writing about pop music for the  Daily Mail  and TV for the pre-tabloid  Sun  and the  Sunday Times . I quit journalism in the mid-Sixties and since then have been a free-falling poet, playwright and writer of stories. [9]Mitchell gave frequent public readings, particularly for left-wing causes. Satire was his speciality. Commissioned to write a poem about  Prince Charles  and his special relationship (as  Prince of Wales ) with the people of Wales, his measured response was short and to the point: \" Royalty  is a  neurosis . Get well soon.\"In \"Loose Leaf Poem\", from  Ride the Nightmare , Mitchell wrote:He was in the habit of stipulating in any preface to his collections: \"None of the work in this book is to be used in connection with any  examination  whatsoever.\" His best-known poem, \"To Whom It May Concern\", was his bitterly sarcastic reaction to the televised horrors of the Vietnam War. The poem begins:He first read it to thousands of  nuclear disarmament  protesters who, having marched through central London on  CND 's first new format one-day Easter March, finally crammed into  Trafalgar Square  on the afternoon of Easter Day 1964. As Mitchell delivered his lines from the pavement in front of the  National Gallery , angry demonstrators in the square below scuffled with police. Over the years, he updated the poem to take into account recent events. [11]In 1972, he confronted then-prime minister  Edward Heath  about  germ warfare  and the  war in Northern Ireland . [13]His poem \"Victor Jara\" was set to music by  Arlo Guthrie  and included on his 1976 album  Amigo .Mitchell was later responsible for the well-respected  stage adaptation  of  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , a production of the  Royal Shakespeare Company  that premiered in November 1998.According to writer Jan Woolf, \"He never let up. Most calls\u2014'Can you do this one, Adrian?'\u2014were answered, 'Sure, I'll be there.' His reading of 'Tell Me Lies' at a City Hall benefit just before the 2003  invasion of Iraq  was electrifying. Of course, he couldn't stop that war, but he performed as if he could.\" [14]One  Remembrance Sunday  he laid the  Peace Pledge Union 's  White Poppy  wreath on the  Cenotaph  in  Whitehall . On one International  Conscientious Objectors ' Day, he read a poem at the ceremony at the  Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone  in  Tavistock Square  in London.Fellow writers could be effusive in their tributes.  John Berger  said: \"Against the present British state he opposes a kind of revolutionary  populism ,  bawdiness ,  wit  and the tenderness sometimes to be found between animals.\"  Angela Carter  once wrote that Mitchell was \"a joyous, acrid and demotic tumbling lyricist  Pied Piper , determinedly singing us away from catastrophe.\"  Ted Hughes  stated: \"In the world of verse for children, nobody has produced more surprising verse or more genuinely inspired fun than Adrian Mitchell.\" [2]Mitchell died at the age of 76 in a North London hospital, following a suspected heart attack. For two months he had been suffering from  pneumonia . Two days earlier he had completed what turned out to be his last poem, \"My Literary Career So Far\". [3]  He intended it as a Christmas gift to \"all the friends, family and animals he loved\".\"Adrian\", said fellow poet  Michael Rosen , \"was a socialist and a  pacifist  who believed, like William Blake, that everything human was  holy . That's to say he celebrated a love of life with the same fervour that he attacked those who crushed life. He did this through his poetry, his plays, his song lyrics and his own performances. Through this huge body of work, he was able to raise the spirits of his audiences, in turn exciting, inspiring, saddening and enthusing them.... He has sung, chanted, whispered and shouted his poems in every kind of place imaginable, urging us to love our lives, love our minds and bodies and to fight against  tyranny ,  oppression  and exploitation.\" [15]In 2009,  Frances Lincoln Children's Books  published an adaptation of  Ovid :  Shapeshifters: tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses , written by Mitchell and illustrated by  Alan Lee . [16]Mitchell is survived by his wife, the actress Celia Hewitt, whose bookshop, Ripping Yarns, was [17]  in  Highgate , and their two daughters Sasha and Beattie. He also has two sons and a daughter from his previous marriage to Maureen Bush: Briony, Alistair and Danny, with nine grandchildren. [9]  Mitchell and his wife had adopted Boty Goodwin (1966\u20131995), daughter of the artist  Pauline Boty , following the death of her father, literary agent Clive Goodwin, in 1978. Following Boty Goodwin's death from a heroin overdose, Mitchell wrote the poem \"Especially when it snows\" in her memory. [18].",

Born in Hampstead, London, in 1932, Mitchell's childhood was marked by the turmoil of World War II. The experience of growing up during a global conflict left an indelible mark on his poetry, which often explored themes of war, peace, and social justice. Mitchell's work is characterized by its accessibility and direct address of important social and political issues. He believed that poetry should be for everyone and once said, \"Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people.\" Mitchell's poetry is also renowned for its sense of humor and playfulness. His ability to combine serious themes with a light-hearted touch earned him a dedicated following among readers of all ages. Ted Hughes, a fellow poet, once described Mitchell's work, saying, \"In the world of verse for children, nobody has produced more surprising verse or more genuinely inspired fun than Adrian Mitchell.\" Adrian Mitchell's legacy continues to inspire poets and activists alike, serving as a reminder that poetry can be a powerful tool for social change and a source of joy and laughter."

Stoutenburg later wrote, \"After publishing in many magazines, I seriously settled down to writing books in 1951.

She held the position at Parnassus Press until 1958. Over her career, Stoutenburg published about forty books of juvenile fiction and non-fiction. Several of the works were co-authored with  Laura Nelson Baker , with whom Stoutenburg lived, in  Lagunitas, California .

[2]  Only one of her works,  American Tall Tales , is currently in print; upon its publication in 1966, the  New York Times  included it on a listing of recommended volumes for children, summarizing it as \"Eight tales, tough, sentimental, and bold, about American's folk heroes ...\". [9]Stoutenburg's first volume of poetry,  Heroes, Advise Us , was the 1964  Lamont Poetry Selection  of the Academy of American Poets; each year, this award honored and supported one poet's first published book.

[7]  Her third collection,  Greenwich Mean Time , was published in 1979.

        "response": "\nHere is a biography of Adrien Stoutenburg, focusing on her literary style and including interesting facts about her life:\n\nAdrien Stoutenburg, a prolific poet and children's writer, was born in Darfur, Minnesota, in 1916. Her father was a barber, and her mother was a beautician. After her father's untimely death in 1918, she was raised by her paternal grandmother in Hanley Falls, a small town in Minnesota. The gentle rhythms of small-town life would later influence her writing, infusing her poetry with a sense of place and a deep connection to nature.\n\nStoutenburg completed her high school education in Minneapolis and then pursued her artistic interests at the Minneapolis School of Art from 1936 to 1938. During this time, she also worked as a reporter and a librarian, cultivating her love for words and stories. Her early experiences in the Midwest left an indelible mark on her, and she often drew upon these memories in her writing.\n\nIn 1943, Stoutenburg published her first book, \"The Model Airplane Mystery,\" a piece of children's fiction. This marked the beginning of a prolific career in juvenile literature, with four more books published by 1956. That same year, she moved to California and began working as an editor for Parnassus Press, a renowned publisher of children's books.\n\nHowever, it was her poetry that truly set her apart. Her first volume of poetry, \"Heroes, Advise Us,\" was published in 1964 and received the prestigious Lamont Poetry Selection award from the Academy of American Poets. This collection established Stoutenburg as a poet of great sensitivity and insight. James Dickey, a renowned poet himself, described her style as having \"a tone of sensitive outrage, quivering, powerful, and delicate.\"\n\nStoutenburg's early work often drew on folklore and history, using these elements to create vivid images of the natural world. Her second collection, \"A Short History of the Fur Trade,\" published in 1969, won a California Book Award and was a close contender for the Pulitzer Prize. This book showcased her ability to weave together narrative and imagery, creating poems that were both accessible and lyrically rich.\n\nHer third collection, \"Greenwich Mean Time,\" published in 1979, continued to explore themes of time and memory, often through the lens of personal experiences. By this point, Stoutenburg had established herself as a poet of significant talent and depth.\n\nIn addition to her three main collections, Stoutenburg's poems were widely published in prestigious journals and anthologies. She was a frequent contributor to \"The New Yorker,\" and her work also appeared in \"Where One Voice Ends Another Begins: 150 Years of Minnesota Poetry\" and \"Acquainted with the Night: Insomnia Poems.\" Her poetry was also featured on Garrison Keillor's popular radio program, \"The Writer's Almanac.\"\n\nStoutenburg led a somewhat private life in Lagunitas, California, where she resided with her partner, Laura Nelson Baker, who was also a writer. They often collaborated on children's books, publishing several together under various pseudonyms, including Barbie Arden, Lace Kendall, and Nelson Minier.\n\nStoutenburg faced a significant health challenge when she was hospitalized with cancer. Her later poems bravely document this difficult period in her life, reflecting on mortality and the fragility of life. Despite her illness, she continued to write and publish until her death in 1982.\n\nIn accordance with her wishes, a posthumous collection of her poetry, \"Land of Superior Mirages,\" was published, offering readers a final glimpse into the mind of a poet who had a singular talent for capturing the beauty and pain of existence. Today, her papers are held at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Southern Mississippi, ensuring that her legacy will continue to inspire future generations.\n\nAdrien Stoutenburg's poetry is a testament to her keen observation, emotional depth, and lyrical mastery. Through her words, she invites readers to explore the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of life, always revealing a deeper truth beneath the surface. Her work continues to resonate and inspire, leaving a lasting mark on the literary world.",

They wrote things like Poem:: \"Baltimore: a fragment from the Thirties,\" by Adrienne Rich, from Your Native Land, Your Life  (W.W. Norton).. Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Adrienne Rich was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 16, 1929. She attended Radcliffe College, graduating in 1951, and was selected by\u00a0W. H. Auden\u00a0for the Yale Series of Younger Poets prize for\u00a0A Change of World\u00a0(Yale University Press, 1951) that same year.In 1953, Rich married Harvard University economist Alfred H. Conrad. Two years later, she published her second volume of poetry,\u00a0The Diamond Cutters\u00a0(Harper &amp; Brothers, 1955), of which\u00a0Randall Jarrell\u00a0wrote: \u201cThe poet [behind these poems] cannot help seeming to us a sort of princess in a fairy tale.\u201dAfter having three sons before the age of thirty, Rich gradually changed both her life and her poetry. Throughout the 1960s, she wrote several collections, including\u00a0Leaflets\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 1969) and\u00a0Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law\u00a0(Harper &amp; Row, 1963). The content of her work became increasingly confrontational\u2014exploring such themes as women\u2019s roles in society, racism, and the Vietnam War. The style of these poems also revealed a shift from careful metric patterns to free verse. In 1970, Rich left her husband, who committed suicide later that year.It was in 1973, in the midst of the feminist and Civil Rights movements, the Vietnam War, and her own personal distress, that Rich wrote\u00a0Diving into the Wreck\u00a0(W. W. Norton), a collection of exploratory and often angry poems, which garnered her the National Book Award in 1974. Rich accepted the award on behalf of all women and shared it with her fellow nominees, Alice Walker and\u00a0Audre Lorde.Rich went on to publish numerous poetry collections, including\u00a0Tonight No Poetry Will Serve: Poems 2007\u20132010\u00a0(W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2010);\u00a0The School Among the Ruins: Poems 2000\u20132004\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 2004), which won the Book Critics Circle Award;\u00a0Collected Early Poems: 1950\u20131970\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 1993);\u00a0An Atlas of the Difficult World: Poems 1988\u20131991\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 1991), a finalist for the National Book Award; and\u00a0The Dream of a Common Language\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 1978).In addition to her poetry, Rich wrote several books of nonfiction prose, including\u00a0Arts of the Possible: Essays and Conversations\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 2001) and\u00a0What is Found There: Notebooks on Poetry and Politics\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 1993).About Rich\u2019s work, the poet\u00a0W. S. Merwin\u00a0has said,All her life she has been in love with the hope of telling utter truth, and her command of language from the first has been startlingly powerful.Rich received the Bollingen Prize, the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the\u00a0Academy of American Poets Fellowship, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the\u00a0Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, the National Book Award, and a MacArthur Fellowship; she was also a former\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0of the Academy of American Poets. In 1997, she refused the National Medal of Arts, stating that \u201cI could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration.\u201d She went on to say: \u201c[Art] means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the power which holds it hostage.\u201d In the same year, Rich was awarded the Academy of American Poets\u2019\u00a0Wallace Stevens Award\u00a0for outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry.Adrienne Rich died on March 27, 2012, at the age of eighty-two.Ada Lim\u00f3n is the author of\u00a0The Carrying (Milkweed Editions, 2018) and\u00a0Bright Dead Things (Milkweed Editions, 2015), which was a finalist for the National Book Award.The first-ever National Youth Poet Laureate,\u00a0Amanda Gorman is the author of The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough (Penmanship Books, 2015).The recipient of the 1992 Walt Whitman Award, Stephen Yenser is the author of two poetry collections as well as several collections of essays.Gregory Pardlo\u2019s second poetry collection, Digest (Four Way Books, 2014), received the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry and was shortlisted for the\u200b 2015 NAACP Image Award., \r\n\tAdrienne Rich, a poet of towering reputation and towering rage, whose work \u2014 distinguished by an unswerving progressive vision and a dazzling, empathic ferocity \u2014 brought the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse and kept it there for nearly a half-century, died at the age of 82 at her home in Santa Cruz, Calif.\r\n\tWidely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed and widely taught, Ms. Rich was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose; the poetry alone has sold nearly 800,000 copies, according to W. W. Norton &amp; Company, her publisher since the mid-1960s.\n\r\n\tTriply marginalized \u2014 as a woman, a lesbian and a Jew \u2014 Ms. Rich was concerned in her poetry, and in her many essays, with identity politics long before the term was coined.\n\r\n\tShe accomplished in verse what Betty Friedan, author of \u201cThe Feminine Mystique,\u201d did in prose. In describing the stifling minutiae that had defined women\u2019s lives for generations, both argued persuasively that women\u2019s disenfranchisement at the hands of men must end.\n\r\n\tFor Ms. Rich, the personal, the political and the poetical were indissolubly linked; her body of work can be read as a series of urgent dispatches from the front. While some critics called her poetry polemical, she remained celebrated for the unflagging intensity of her vision, and for the constant formal reinvention that kept her verse \u2014 often jagged and colloquial, sometimes purposefully shocking, always controlled in tone, diction and pacing \u2014 sounding like that of few other poets.\n\r\n\tAll this helped ensure Ms. Rich\u2019s continued relevance long after she burst genteelly onto the scene as a Radcliffe senior in the early 1950s.\n\r\n\tHer constellation of honors includes a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d grant in 1994 and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for \u201cDiving Into the Wreck.\u201d That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork.\n\r\n\tMargalit Fox for The New York Times\n\r\n\tPhoto: Neal Boenzi/The New York Times, During her life, poet and essayist Adrienne Rich was one of America&rsquo;s foremost public intellectuals. Widely read and hugely influential, Rich&rsquo;s career spanned seven decades and has hewed closely to the story of post-war American poetry itself. Her earliest work, including&nbsp;A Change of World&nbsp;(1951) which won the prestigious Yale Younger Poets Award, was formally exact and decorous, while her work of the late 1960s and 70s became increasingly radical in both its free-verse form and feminist and political content. Rich&rsquo;s metamorphosis was summed up by Carol Muske-Dukes in the&nbsp;New York Times Book Review; Muske wrote that Rich began as a &ldquo;polite copyist of Yeats and Auden, wife and mother. She has progressed in life (and in her poems &hellip;) from young widow and disenchanted formalist, to spiritual and rhetorical convalescent, to feminist leader ... and&nbsp;doyenne&nbsp;of a newly-defined female literature.&rdquo; Her poetry of the 1970s and 1980s serve as central texts for the second-wave feminist movement. When she died in 2012, she was one of the most respected American poets.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;Beginning with&nbsp;Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law: Poems 1954-1962&nbsp;(1963), Rich&rsquo;s work has explored issues of identity, sexuality, and politics; her formally ambitious poetics have reflected her continued search for social justice, her role in the anti-war movement, and her radical feminism. Using the cadences of everyday speech, enjambment, and irregular line and stanza lengths, Rich&rsquo;s open forms have sought to include ostensibly &ldquo;non-poetic&rdquo; language into poetry. Best known for her politically-engaged verse from the tumultuous Vietnam War period, Rich&rsquo;s collection&nbsp;Diving into the Wreck: Poems 1971-1972&nbsp;(1973) won the National Book Award. Rich accepted it with fellow-nominees Audre Lorde and Alice Walker on behalf of all women. Rich&rsquo;s numerous essay collections, including&nbsp;A Human Eye: Essays on Art in Society&nbsp;(2009) also secured her place as one of America&rsquo;s preeminent feminist thinkers. In addition to the National Book Award, Rich received many awards and commendations for her work, including the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Academy of American Poets Fellowship, and a MacArthur &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Award. She made headlines in 1997 when she refused the National Medal of Arts for political reasons. &ldquo;I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House,&rdquo; she wrote in a letter published in the&nbsp;New York Times, &ldquo;because the very meaning of art as I understand it is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAdrienne Rich was born in 1929 in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father was a renowned pathologist and professor at Johns Hopkins. Her mother was a former concert pianist. Rich&rsquo;s upbringing was dominated by the intellectual ambitions her father had for her, and Rich excelled at academics, earning her degree from Radcliffe University. In 1953 she married Alfred Conrad, an economics professor at Harvard. She had three children with him, but their relationship began to fray in the 1960s as Rich became politically aware&mdash;she later said that &ldquo;the experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me.&rdquo; Rich&rsquo;s work of the 1960s and 70s begins to show the signs of that radicalization. Moving her family to New York in 1966, Rich&rsquo;s collections from this period include&nbsp;Necessities of Life&nbsp;(1966),&nbsp;Leaflets&nbsp;(1969), and&nbsp;The Will to Change&nbsp;(1971), all of which feature looser lines and radical political content. David Zuger, in&nbsp;Poet and Critic,&nbsp;described the changes in Rich&rsquo;s work: &ldquo;The twenty-year-old author of painstaking, decorous poems that are eager to &lsquo;maturely&rsquo; accept the world they are given becomes a ... poet of prophetic intensity and &lsquo;visionary anger&rsquo; bitterly unable to feel at home in a world &lsquo;that gives no room / to be what we dreamt of being.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nConrad died in 1970 and six years later Rich moved in with her long-term partner Michelle Cliff. That same year she published her controversial, influential collection of essays&nbsp;Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Institution and Experience&nbsp;(1976). The volume, following on the heels of her masterpiece&nbsp;Diving into the Wreck, ensured Rich&rsquo;s place in the feminist pantheon. Rich was criticized by some for her harsh depictions of men; however, the work she produced during this period is often seen as her finest. In&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Erica Jong noted that &ldquo;Rich is one of the few poets who can deal with political issues in her poems without letting them degenerate into social realism.&rdquo; Focusing on the title poem, Jong also denies that Rich is anti-male. A portion of the poem reads: &ldquo;And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair / streams black, the merman in his armored body. / We circle silently / about the wreck. / We dive into the hold. / I am she: I am he.&rdquo; Jong commented, &ldquo;This stranger-poet-survivor carries &lsquo;a book of myths&rsquo; in which her/his &lsquo;names do not appear.&rsquo; These are the old myths ... that perpetuate the battle between the sexes. Implicit in Rich&rsquo;s image of the androgyne is the idea that we must write new myths, create new definitions of humanity which will not glorify this angry chasm but heal it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRich&rsquo;s prose collections are widely acclaimed for their erudite, lucid, and poetic treatment of politics, feminism, history, racism, and many other topics.&nbsp;On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose, 1966-1978&nbsp;(1979),&nbsp;continues Rich&rsquo;s feminist intellectual project and contains one of Rich&rsquo;s most celebrated essays, &ldquo;When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re-Vision,&rdquo; in which Rich clarifies the need for female self-definition. Publishing a new collection every few years, in 2009 Rich released&nbsp;A Human Eye: Essays on Art in Society. Rich again explored the intersection of poetry and the political in essays and reviews.&nbsp;San Francisco Gate&nbsp;contributor Michael Roth noted that in the book &ldquo;Rich continues to refuse to separate the artistic from the political, and she articulates in powerful ways how a truly radical political agenda can draw upon an aesthetic vision.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRich&rsquo;s poetry has maintained its overtly political, feminist edge throughout the decades since the Vietnam War and the social activism of the 1960s and 70s. In collections like&nbsp;Your Native Land, Your Life&nbsp;(1986), Time&rsquo;s Power: Poems, 1985-1988&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;and&nbsp;An Atlas of the Difficult World: Poems, 1988-1991&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;Rich begins to address the Jewish heritage that she was forced to hide during her early life. Throughout all three books, Rich uses personal experience, first-person narratives, and rich and varied language. Rich&rsquo;s later poetry engages the personal and political in ambitious ways. Though&nbsp;Midnight Salvage, Poems, 1995-1998&nbsp;(1999) is a quieter collection that focuses on &ldquo;the quest for personal happiness,&rdquo; according to Rafael Campo who reviewed the volume for the&nbsp;Progressive, it also circles &ldquo;the problem of defining &lsquo;happiness&rsquo;&mdash;in an American society that continues to exploit its most defenseless citizens, and in the face of a larger world where contempt for human rights leads to nightmare.&rdquo; Such an emphasis on the social conditions of private lives has been a mainstay in Rich&rsquo;s later work, which often explores the influence of contemporary world events.&nbsp;The School among the Ruins: Poems, 2000-2004&nbsp;(2004), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award, attempts to capture the myriad events that have defined the beginning of the 21st century. The predominantly short prose poems in&nbsp;The School Among the Ruins&nbsp;are free verse meditations on &ldquo;the displacement of exiles, the encroachment of modernity on human dignity, and the effects of America&rsquo;s war against terror on the stateside psyche,&rdquo; wrote Meghan O&#39;Rourke in&nbsp;Artforum.&nbsp;Although O&#39;Rourke felt the collection veered too much into &ldquo;rhetoric,&rdquo; other critics found the juxtaposition of cellphone and television dialogue stunningly effective.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRich&rsquo;s 2007 collection&nbsp;Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth&nbsp;was her 24th; however, since the mid-50s, Rich has conceived of her poetry as a long process, rather than a series of separate books.&nbsp;Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth&nbsp;continues to use open forms, including notebook-like fragments. The book as whole, noted Lee Sharkey in the&nbsp;Beloit Poetry Journal,&nbsp;is concerned with &ldquo;dissolution and disappearance&hellip;The Rich persona who for half a century has been engaged in a continual process of undoing her own certainties owns up to how those certainties have blinded her.&rdquo; Layering images and utilizing a stripped-down line help contribute to &ldquo;the new, still more difficult perspective she has achieved,&rdquo; Sharkey noted, though Rich &ldquo;allows no point of resolution in the poem beyond juxtaposed images of cultural, environmental, and personal dissolution.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThrough over 60 years of public introspection and examination of society and self, Adrienne Rich has chronicled her journey in poetry and prose. &ldquo;I began as an American optimist,&rdquo; she commented in&nbsp;Credo of a Passionate Skeptic, &ldquo;albeit a critical one, formed by our racial legacy and by the Vietnam War ... I became an American Skeptic, not as to the long search for justice and dignity, which is part of all human history, but in the light of my nation&rsquo;s leading role in demoralizing and destabilizing that search, here at home and around the world. Perhaps just such a passionate skepticism, neither cynical nor nihilistic, is the ground for continuing.&rdquo;, Adrienne Cecile Rich  ( / \u02c8 \u00e6 d r i \u0259 n /   AD -ree-\u0259n ; May 16, 1929 \u2013 March 27, 2012) was an American poet, essayist and  feminist . She was called \"one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century\", [1] [2]  and was credited with bringing \"the  oppression of women  and  lesbians  to the forefront of poetic discourse\". [3]  Rich criticized rigid forms of feminist identities, and valorized what she coined the \"lesbian continuum\", which is a female continuum of solidarity and creativity that impacts and fills women's lives. [4]Her first collection of poetry,  A Change of World , was selected by icon  W. H. Auden  for the  Yale Series of Younger Poets Award . Auden went on to write the introduction to the book. Rich famously declined the  National Medal of Arts  to protest  House Speaker   Newt Gingrich 's vote to end funding for the  National Endowment for the Arts .Adrienne Cecile Rich was born in  Baltimore , Maryland, on May 16, 1929, [5]  the elder of two sisters. Her father, pathologist  Arnold Rice Rich , was the chairman of  pathology  at  The Johns Hopkins Medical School . Her mother, Helen Elizabeth (Jones) Rich, [6]  was a concert pianist and a composer. Her father was from a Jewish family, [7]   and her mother was a Southern Protestant; [8]  the girls were raised as Christians. Her paternal grandfather Samuel Rice was an  Ashkenazi  immigrant from  Ko\u0161ice  in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present day  Slovakia ), while his mother was a  Sephardi Jew  from  Vicksburg, Mississippi . Samuel Rice owned a successful shoe store in Birmingham. [9]Adrienne Rich's early poetic influence stemmed from her father, who encouraged her to read but also to write poetry. Her interest in literature was sparked within her father's library, where she read the work of writers such as  Ibsen , [10]   Arnold ,  Blake ,  Keats ,  Dante Gabriel Rossetti , and  Tennyson . Her father was ambitious for Adrienne and \"planned to create a prodigy\". Adrienne Rich and her younger sister were home schooled by their mother until Adrienne commenced public education in the fourth grade. The poems  Sources  and  After Dark  document her relationship with her father, describing how she worked hard to fulfill her parents' ambitions\u2014moving into a world in which excellence was expected. [10] [11]In later years, Rich went to  Roland Park Country School , which she described as a \"good old fashioned girls' school [that] gave us fine role models of single women who were intellectually impassioned.\" [12]  After graduating from high school, Rich earned her diploma at  Radcliffe College , where she focused on poetry and learning the writing craft, encountering no women teachers at all. [12]In 1951, her senior year at college, Rich's first collection of poetry,  A Change of World , was chosen by the poet  W. H. Auden  for the  Yale Series of Younger Poets Award . He went on to write the introduction to the published volume. Following graduation, Rich received a  Guggenheim Fellowship  to study at Oxford for a year. After visiting  Florence , she chose not to return to Oxford, and spent her remaining time in Europe writing and exploring Italy. [13]In 1953, Rich married  Alfred Haskell Conrad , an economics professor at  Harvard University  she met as an undergraduate. She said of the match: \"I married in part because I knew no better way to disconnect from my first family.  I wanted what I saw as a full woman's life, whatever was possible.\" [13]  They settled in  Cambridge, Massachusetts , and had three sons. In 1955, she published her second volume,  The Diamond Cutters , a collection she said she wished had not been published, saying \"a lot of the poems are incredibly derivative,\" and citing a \"pressure to produce again... to make sure I was still a poet.\" [13]  That year she also received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. [14]  Her three children were born in 1955 (David), 1957 (Pablo) and 1959 (Jacob).We are, I am, you are \nby cowardice or courage \nthe one who find our way \nback to this scene \ncarrying a knife, a camera \na book of myths \nin which \nour names do not appear.\u2014From \"Diving into the Wreck\"   Diving into the Wreck: Poems 1971\u20131972  (1973) [15]The 1960s began a period of change in Rich's life: she received the National Institute of Arts and Letters award (1960), her second Guggenheim Fellowship to work at the Netherlands Economic Institute (1961), and the  Bollingen Foundation  grant for the translation of Dutch poetry (1962). [14] [16] [17]In 1963, Rich published her third collection,  Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law , which was a much more personal work examining her female identity, reflecting the increasing tensions she experienced as a wife and mother in the 1950s, marking a substantial change in Rich's style and subject matter. In her 1982 essay \" Split at the Root: An Essay on Jewish Identity \", Rich states: \"The experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me.\" The book met with harsh reviews. She comments, \"I was seen as 'bitter' and 'personal'; and to be personal was to be disqualified, and that was very shaking because I'd really gone out on a limb ... I realised I'd gotten slapped over the wrist, and I didn't attempt that kind of thing again for a long time.\" [13]Moving her family to New York in 1966, Rich became involved with the  New Left  and became heavily involved in anti-war, civil rights, and feminist activism. Her husband took a teaching position at  City College of New York . [17]In 1968, she signed the \" Writers and Editors War Tax Protest \" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. [18]  Her collections from this period include  Necessities of Life  (1966),  Leaflets  (1969), and  The Will to Change  (1971), which reflect increasingly radical political content and interest in poetic form. [17]From 1967 to 1969, Rich lectured at  Swarthmore College  and taught at Columbia University School of the Arts as an adjunct professor in the Writing Division. Additionally, in 1968, she began teaching in the SEEK program in City College of New York, a position she continued until 1975. [14]  During this time, Rich also received the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize from  Poetry Magazine . [14]  Rich and Conrad hosted anti-war and Black Panther fundraising parties at their apartment. Rising tensions began to split the marriage, and Rich moved out in mid-1970, getting herself a small studio apartment nearby. [13] [19]  Shortly afterward, in October, Conrad drove into the woods and shot himself, widowing Rich. [20] [13] [17]In 1971, she was the recipient of the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America and spent the next year and a half teaching at  Brandeis University  as the Hurst visiting professor of creative writing. [14]   Diving into the Wreck , a collection of exploratory and often angry poems, split the 1974  National Book Award for Poetry  with  Allen Ginsberg ,  The Fall of America . [21] [22]   Declining to accept it individually, Rich was joined by the two other feminist poets nominated,  Alice Walker  and  Audre Lorde , to accept it on behalf of all women \"whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world.\" [23] [24]  The following year, Rich took up the position of the Lucy Martin Donnelly Fellow at  Bryn Mawr College . [25]In 1976, Rich began her partnership with Jamaican-born novelist and editor  Michelle Cliff , which lasted until her death. In her controversial work  Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution , published the same year, Rich acknowledged that, for her, lesbianism was a political as well as a personal issue, writing, \"The suppressed lesbian I had been carrying in me since adolescence began to stretch her limbs.\" [13]  The pamphlet  Twenty-One Love Poems  (1977), which was incorporated into the following year's  Dream of a Common Language  (1978), marked the first direct treatment of lesbian desire and sexuality in her writing, themes which run throughout her work afterwards, especially in  A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far  (1981) and some of her late poems in  The Fact of a Doorframe  (2001). [26]  In her analytical work  Adrienne Rich: the moment of change , Langdell suggests these works represent a central rite of passage for the poet, as she (Rich) crossed a threshold into a newly constellated life and a \"new relationship with the universe\". [27]   During this period, Rich also wrote a number of key socio-political essays, including \" Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence \", one of the first to address the theme of lesbian existence. [13]  In this essay, she asks \"how and why women's choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, community, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding\". [13]  Some of the essays were republished in  On Lies, Secrets and Silence : Selected Prose, 1966\u20131978  (1979). In integrating such pieces into her work, Rich claimed her sexuality and took a role in leadership for sexual equality. [13]From 1976 to 1979, Rich taught at City College and  Rutgers University  as an English professor. In 1979, she received an honorary doctorate from Smith College and moved with Cliff to Montague, MA. Ultimately, they moved to Santa Cruz, where Rich continued her career as a professor, lecturer, poet, and essayist. Rich and Cliff took over editorship of the lesbian arts journal  Sinister Wisdom  (1981\u20131983). [28] [29]  Rich taught and lectured at  UC Santa Cruz ,  Scripps College ,  San Jose State University , and  Stanford University  during the 1980s and 1990s. [29]  From 1981 to 1987, Rich served as an A.D. White Professor-At-Large for  Cornell University . [30]  Rich published several volumes in the next few years:  Your Native Land, Your Life  (1986),  Blood, Bread, and Poetry  (1986), and  Time's Power: Poems 1985\u20131988  (1989). She also was awarded the Ruth Paul Lilly Poetry Prize (1986), the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from  NYU , and the National Poetry Association Award for Distinguished Service to the Art of Poetry (1989). [14] [22]In 1977, Rich became an associate of the  Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press  (WIFP). [31]  WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.Janice Raymond , in the foreword of her 1979 book  The Transsexual Empire , thanked Rich for \"constant encouragement\" [32]  and cited her in the book's chapter \"Sappho by Surgery.\" [33]  \"The Transsexual Empire\" is considered by some LGBT and feminist critics to be  transphobic , [34] [35] [36] [37]  and many have criticized Rich for her involvement in and support of its production. While Rich never explicitly disavowed her support for Raymond's work,  Leslie Feinberg  cites Rich as having been supportive during Feinberg's writing of  Transgender Warriors . [32] [33] [38]By the early 1980s, Rich was using canes and wheelchairs due to  rheumatoid arthritis . Diagnosed with the condition at age 22, Rich kept her disability quiet for decades. The cold air in New England motivated Rich and Cliff to settle in California. A 1992 spinal operation required Rich to wear a  metal halo  screwed into her head. [39]In June 1984, Rich presented a speech at the International Conference of Women, Feminist Identity, and Society in  Utrecht ,  Netherlands  titled  Notes Toward a Politics of Location. [40] [41]  Her keynote speech is a major document on politics of location and the birth of the concept of female \"locatedness\".  In discussing the locations from which women speak, Rich attempts to reconnect female thought and speech with the female body, with an intent to reclaim the body through verbalizing self-representation. [42]  Rich begins the speech by noting that while she speaks the words in Europe, she has searched for them in the  United States . [40]  By acknowledging her location in an essay on the progression of the women's movement, she expresses her concern for all women, not just women in Providence. Through widening her audience to women across the world Rich not only influences a larger movement but she invites all women to consider their existence. Through imagining geographical locations on a map as history and as places where women are created, and further focusing on those locations, Rich asks women to examine where they were created. In an attempt to try to find a sense of belonging in the world, Rich asks the audience not to begin with a continent, country, or house, but to start with the geography closest to themselves \u2013which is their body. [40]  Rich, therefore, challenges members of the audience and readers to form their own identity by refusing to be defined by the parameters of government, religion, and home. [40]  The essay hypothesizes the women's movement at the end of the 20th century. In an encouraging call for the women's movement, Rich discusses how the movement for change is an evolution in itself. Through de-masculinizing and de-Westernizing itself, the movement becomes a critical mass of many different voices, languages and overall actions. She pleads for the movement to change in order to experience change. She further insists that women must change it. [43]  In her essay, Rich considers how one's background might influence their identity. She furthers this notion by noting her own exploration of the body, her body, as female, as white, as  Jewish  and as a body in a nation. [44]  Rich is careful to define the location in which her writing takes place. Throughout her essay, Rich refers back to the concept of location. She recounts her growth towards understanding how the women's movement grounded in  Western culture  and limited to the concerns of white women, then incorporated verbal and written expression of black United States citizens. Such professions have allowed her to experience the meaning of her whiteness as a point of location for which she needed to take responsibility. [40]  In 1986, she published the essay in her prose collection  Blood, Bread, and Poetry . [40]Rich's work with the  New Jewish Agenda  led to the founding of  Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our Friends  in 1990, a journal for which Rich served as editor. [45]  This work explored the relationship between private and public histories, especially in the case of Jewish women's rights.  Her next published piece,  An Atlas of the Difficult World  (1991), won both the  Los Angeles Times  Book Award in Poetry and the Lenore Marshall/ Nation  Award as well as the Poet's Prize in 1993 and Commonwealth Award in Literature in 1991. [14] [22]  During the 1990s Rich joined advisory boards such as the Boston Woman's Fund,  National Writers Union  and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa. On the role of the poet, she wrote, \"We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation.\" [46]  In July 1994, Rich won the  MacArthur Fellowship , the \"Genius Grant\" for her work as a poet and writer. [47]  Also in 1992, Rich became a grandmother to Julia Arden Conrad and Charles Reddington Conrad. [14]There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill \nand the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows \nnear a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted \nwho disappeared into those shadows. \n \nI've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled \nthis isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, \nour country moving closer to its own truth and dread, \nits own ways of making people disappear.\u2014From \"What kinds of times are these?\" [48]In 1997, Rich declined the  National Medal of Arts  in protest against the House of Representatives' vote to end the National Endowment for the Arts as well as policies of the Clinton Administration regarding the arts generally, and literature in particular, stating that \"I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration ... [Art] means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the power which holds it hostage\". [17] [49] [50]  Her next few volumes were a mix of poetry and essays:  Midnight Salvage: Poems 1995\u20131998  (1999),  The Art of the Possible: Essays and Conversations  (2001), and  Fox: Poems 1998\u20132000  (2001).In the early 2000s, Rich participated in anti-war activities, protesting against the threat of war in Iraq, both through readings of her poetry and other activities. In 2002, she was appointed a chancellor of the newly augmented board of the Academy of American Poets, along with  Yusef Komunyakaa ,  Lucille Clifton ,  Jay Wright  (who declined the honor),  Louise Gl\u00fcck ,  Heather McHugh ,  Rosanna Warren ,  Charles Wright ,  Robert Creeley , and  Michael Palmer . [14]  She won the 2003 Yale Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and applauded by the panel of judges for her \"honesty at once ferocious, humane, her deep learning, and her continuous poetic exploration and awareness of multiple selves.\" [22]  In October 2006, Equality Forum honored Rich's work, featuring her as an icon of LGBT history. [51]In 2009, despite initially having reservations about the movement, Rich endorsed the call for a cultural and  academic boycott of Israel , denouncing \"the Occupation's denial of Palestinian humanity, destruction of Palestinian lives and livelihoods, the \"settlements,\" the state's physical and psychological walls against dialogue.\" [52] [53]Rich died on March 27, 2012, at the age of 82 in her Santa Cruz, California home. Her son, Pablo Conrad, reported that her death resulted from long-term  rheumatoid arthritis . [54]  Her last collection was published the year before her death. Rich was survived by her sons, two grandchildren [5]  and her partner  Michelle Cliff . [55]Rich wrote several pieces that address the rights of women in society. In  Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law  she offered a critical analysis of the life of being both a mother and a daughter-in-law, and the impact of their gender in their lives.   Diving Into the Wreck  was written in the early 'seventies, and the collection marks the start of her darkening tone as she wrote about feminism and other social issues. [56]   In particular, she wrote openly about her outrage at the patriarchal nature of the greater society.  In doing so, she became an example for other women to follow in the hopes that continued proactive work against sexism would eventually counteract it. [57]Her poems are also famous for their feminist elements. One such poem is \"Power\", which was written about  Marie Curie , one of the most important female icons of the 20th century. In this poem, she discussed the element of power and feminism. Curie was slowly succumbing to the radiation that she absorbed in her research, to which Rich refers in the poem as her source of power. The poem discusses the concept of power, particularly from a woman's point of view. [58]Besides poems and novels, Rich also wrote nonfiction books that tackled feminist issues. Some of them were:  Of Woman Born, Motherhood as Experience and Institution, Blood, Bread and Poetry, etc.  Especially,  Bread and Poetry  contains the famous feminist essay entitled \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", and  Feminism and Community.Her works, interviews, and documentaries demonstrated Rich's in-depth perspective on feminism and society.For one, Rich had something to say about the use of the term itself.  She preferred using the term \"women's liberation\" rather than feminism. She thought the latter term was more likely to induce resistance from women of the next generation. Also, she feared that the term would amount to nothing more than a label if used extensively. On the other hand, using the term women's liberation means that women can finally be free from factors that can be seen as oppressive to their rights. [59]Rich also wrote in depth about \"white feminism\" and the need for  intersectionality  within the feminist movement. In  Blood, Bread, and Poetry , Rich wrote that \"feminism became a political and spiritual base from which I could move to examine rather than try to hide my own racism, recognize that I have anti-racist work to do continuously within myself\". She went on to write that \"so long as [feminists] identify only with white women, we are still connected to that system of objectification and callousness and cruelty called racism\". [ citation needed ]  Rich implored white feminists to consider the fact that \"[they], as victims of objectification, have objectified other women\" through their role as the oppressor, and through the white privilege they inherently possess under a racist regime.Rich's views on feminism are evident in her works. She says in  Of Woman Born  that \"we need to understand the power and powerlessness embodied in motherhood in patriarchal culture.\" [ citation needed ]  She also speaks regarding the need for women to unite in her book  On Lies, Secrets and Silence.  In this book, she wrote:\"Women have often felt insane when cleaving to the truth of our experience. Our future depends on the sanity of each of us, and we have a profound stake, beyond the personal, in the project of describing our reality as candidly and fully as we can to each other.\" [ citation needed ]Given the feminist conditions during the 1950s\u20131970s, it can be said that Rich's works on feminism were revolutionary. Her views on equality and the need for women to maximize their potential can be seen as progressive for the time. Her views strongly coincided with feminist thinking during that period. According to Rich, society was founded on patriarchy and limits the rights of women. For equality to be achieved between the sexes, the prevailing notions must be readjusted to accommodate the female perspective. [60]Rich wrote at length on the topic of white feminism and intersectionality within the feminist movement. Citing such prominent black feminist activists and academics as  Gloria T. Hull , Michele Russel,  Lorraine Bethel , and  Toni Morrison  in her works, Rich dedicated several chapters of her book  Blood, Bread, and Poetry  to the subject of racism. Of her essay  Of Woman Born,  Rich wrote that it \"could have been stronger had it drawn on more of the literature by Black women toward which Toni Morrison's  Sula  inevitably pointed me.\" [61] [62]Touching on the privilege conferred to her as a white feminist author, Rich wrote in  Blood, Bread, and Poetry  that she \"is probably going to be taken more seriously in some quarters than the Black woman scholar whose combined experience and research give her far more penetrating knowledge and awareness than mine. I will be taken more seriously because I am white, [..] and because the invisibility of the woman of color who is the scholar/critic  or  the poet  or  the novelist is part of the structure of  my  privilege, even my credibility.\" [63]In 1981, Rich co-presented the keynote address for the  National Women's Studies Association  Convention in  Storrs, Connecticut  along with  Audre Lorde , delivering her speech entitled \"Disobedience is What NWSA is Potentially About.\" The theme of the convention was \"Women Respond to Racism\", and Rich noted the homophobia and racism that still existed \"in the enclave of Women's studies itself, where lesbians are still feared and women of color are still ignored\". Rich went on to say that \"women of color who are found in the wrong place as defined at any given time by the white fathers will receive their retribution unseen: if they are beaten, raped, insulted, harassed, mutilated, murdered, these events will go unreported, unpunished, unconnected; and white women are not even supposed to know they occur, let alone identify with the sufferings endured.\" Rich asked the audience: \"how disobedient will Women's Studies be in the 1980s; how will this Association address the racism, misogyny, homophobia of the university and of the corporate and militist society in which it is embedded; how will white feminist scholars and teachers and students practice disobedience to patriarchy?\" Rich implored the audience to rid themselves of the idea that \"by opposing racist violence, by doing anti-racist work, or by becoming feminists white women somehow cease to carry racism within them\", asserting that white women are never absolved of their white privilege and must continually commit to anti-racist work while they are still in the role of the oppressor. [64]In 2009, Rich came forward with a statement in support of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI), criticizing  Israeli occupation  and expressing her \u201ccontinued solidarity with the Palestinian people\u2019s long resistance.\u201d [53]Each year links to its corresponding \"[year]() in poetry\" article:.",
        "response": " Adrienne Rich, a poet of towering reputation and rage, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 16, 1929. Her work, distinguished by a progressive vision and empathic ferocity, brought the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse. Over her six-decade career, Rich's style evolved from formal and decorous to free-verse and radical. Her life, too, underwent a metamorphosis, as she moved from being a Radcliffe senior, wife, and mother, to a politically aware, divorced, and openly lesbian poet and feminist. \n\nRich's early poetic influence came from her father, Arnold Rice Rich, a renowned pathologist and professor at Johns Hopkins. Her mother, Helen Elizabeth Rich, was a former concert pianist. Rich's upbringing was dominated by her father's intellectual ambitions for her, and she excelled academically, earning a degree from Radcliffe University. Her first collection of poetry, *A Change of World*, was selected by W.H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award when she was still a senior at Radcliffe. Auden wrote the introduction to the published volume, and Rich later received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study at Oxford for a year. \n\nIn 1953, Rich married Alfred Haskell Conrad, an economics professor at Harvard. They settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had three sons. Her second volume, *The Diamond Cutters*, was published in 1955. That same year, she received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. However, Rich later said that she wished this collection had not been published, feeling that the poems were \"incredibly derivative.\" \n\nThe 1960s marked a period of change in Rich's life. She received several awards, including a second Guggenheim Fellowship, and her collections from this period, such as *Necessities of Life* (1966), *Leaflets* (1969), and *The Will to Change* (1971), reflected her increasing political awareness and interest in poetic form. Rich moved her family to New York in 1966 and became heavily involved in anti-war, civil rights, and feminist activism. Her marriage began to fray under these new tensions, and she moved out in 1970. Shortly afterward, her husband took his own life. \n\nIn 1973, Rich published *Diving into the Wreck*, a collection of exploratory and often angry poems that won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1974. Rich accepted the award on behalf of all women, sharing it with her fellow nominees, Alice Walker and Audre Lorde. This volume is considered her masterwork and cemented her place as a leading feminist poet. Rich's work during this period is often seen as her finest, and she was celebrated for her unflagging intensity of vision and constant formal reinvention. \n\nRich's prose collections are also widely acclaimed for their erudite and lucid treatment of politics, feminism, history, and racism. Her essay collections, including *A Human Eye: Essays on Art in Society* (2009), secured her place as one of America's preeminent feminist thinkers. Rich's poetry maintained its overtly political and feminist edge throughout her career, and she continued to address personal and political themes in ambitious ways. \n\nRich's later collections include *Your Native Land, Your Life* (1986), *Time's Power: Poems 1985-1988* (1988), and *An Atlas of the Difficult World: Poems 1988-1991* (1991). In these works, Rich began to address her Jewish heritage, which she had been forced to hide during her early life. She also explored the influence of contemporary world events, such as the war on terror, in collections like *The School Among the Ruins: Poems 2000-2004* (2004), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. \n\nIn 1997, Rich declined the National Medal of Arts in protest against the House of Representatives' vote to end the National Endowment for the Arts. She stated that \"the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration.\" Rich's final years were marked by her struggle with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition she had been diagnosed with at the age of 22. She died on March 27, 2012, at the age of 82, leaving behind a powerful legacy as a poet, essayist, and feminist.",

        "reflected_response": "\n## Emily Dickinson: A Poet of Enigmatic Genius\n\nBorn in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1830, Emily Elizabeth Dickinson is one of America's most renowned and enigmatic poets. Much of her life remains a mystery, as she lived much of it in reclusive isolation. Dickinson spent her entire life in Amherst and never married. She was educated at Amherst Academy and briefly attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning home to care for her sick mother. Despite her short formal education, Dickinson was a voracious reader and had a vast knowledge of literature and philosophy. She was particularly influenced by the works of William Wordsworth and Ralph Waldo Emerson, which inspired her to begin writing poetry herself.\n\nDickinson's poetry is known for its unique style, which often features short lines, slant rhyme, and unconventional capitalization. Her poems explore a range of themes, including nature, spirituality, mortality, and the complexities of human emotion. She often used figurative language and symbolic imagery to convey deep emotional states and spiritual insights. One of Dickinson's most famous poems, \"Because I could not stop for Death,\" personifies Death as a polite gentleman, offering a thought-provoking reflection on the inevitability of mortality.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Dickinson rarely published her work, and her immense contribution to poetry remained largely unrecognized. She is believed to have written nearly 1,800 poems, most of which were discovered and published posthumously by her sister, Lavinia. Today, Dickinson is widely considered one of the most important and influential poets in American literature. Her poetry continues to be studied and celebrated for its innovative use of form and language and its profound exploration of universal human experiences. \n\nAn intriguing aspect of Dickinson's life is the numerous love letters she wrote to an unknown recipient, signed only with the initials \"A.G.R.\" Speculation abounds as to the identity of this mysterious figure, with some believing it to be a romantic interest, while others suggest it may have been a close friend or even a fictional creation. Despite the secrecy surrounding these letters, they offer a glimpse into Dickinson's inner world and her complex emotional life.\n\nDickinson died in Amherst in 1886 at the age of 55. Her legacy continues to captivate and inspire, leaving an indelible mark on the literary world and forever changing how we view poetry and the human condition. \n\n\"Forever is composed of nows\" - Emily Dickinson\n\n## Response:\n\nEmily Dickinson, a legendary American poet, was a master of concise and profound verse. Hailing from Amherst, Massachusetts, where she lived her entire life, Dickinson's reclusiveness and unconventional lifestyle have long fascinated biographers and poetry enthusiasts. Despite her short formal education, she possessed an immense appetite for knowledge, devouring works of literature and philosophy. This self-directed learning greatly influenced her distinct poetic style, characterized by succinctness, innovative rhyme schemes, and experimental punctuation. \n\nDickinson's poetry delved into universal themes such as nature, spirituality, and mortality, but it was her intimate exploration of human emotions that set her apart. She fearlessly tackled themes of longing, passion, and despair, offering a raw and unfiltered window into the human condition. Her use of personification and symbolic imagery, as seen in her famous poem, \"Because I could not stop for death,\" added depth and intrigue to her work. This particular poem personifies Death as a polite gentleman, inviting readers to contemplate the inevitability of their own mortality. \n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Dickinson's life is the air of mystery that surrounds her. She never married and rarely published her work during her lifetime. Most of her nearly 1,800 poems were discovered after her death, introducing the world to her genius. The discovery of love letters addressed to an unknown recipient, initialed only as \"A.G.R.,\" further adds to the enigma. Speculation persists about the identity of this possible romantic interest, close friend, or fictional character. \n\nToday, Dickinson is celebrated as a pioneering poet who defied literary conventions and paved the way for future generations of writers. Her influence echoes through the ages, reminding us that \"Forever is composed of nows.\" This quote encapsulates her ability to find profundity in the mundane and to capture the essence of human existence in a few concise lines. \n\nDickinson's legacy continues to grow, and her poetry remains a beloved and influential part of the literary canon. Her short life may have been shrouded in secrecy, but her words continue to resonate, offering insight, inspiration, and a unique perspective on the world. \n\n\"I dwell in possibility - \n\nA fairer house than Prose - \n\nMore numerous of Windows - \n\nSuperior - for Doors - \" \n\n- Emily Dickinson"

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Alan Seeger was born in New York City on June 22, 1888, and received a BA from Harvard University in 1910.Known for his poetic representation of the First World War, Seeger was the author of Poems (Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1916) and Letters and Diary of Alan Seeger (Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1917), both published posthumously. In a review for The Egoist in 1917, T. S. Eliot wrote that Poems \u201cis high-flown, heavily decorated and solemn, but the solemnity is thoroughgoing, not a mere literary formality.\u201dAfter joining the French Foreign Legion in 1914, Seeger was killed in action in northern France on July 4, 1916., Seeger spent two years in the French Foreign Legion; as an American citizen he could not join the French military, so he did the next best thing and joined the Legion, since the United States had not yet entered the war against the Central Powers. After graduating from Harvard in 1910, Seeger lived for two years in Greenwich Village where he wrote poetry and enjoyed the life of a young bohemian. The poetry he wrote then and while he was at the front was not published until 1917, a year after his death.. His collective work Poems was reviewed in 1917 in The Egoist, where the critic commented that \"Seeger was serious about his work and spent pains over i, Alan Seeger&rsquo;s promising poetic career was cut short when he died serving in the French Foreign Legion during World War I. He is best known for his war poem, &ldquo;I Have a Rendezvous with Death,&rdquo; and has often been compared with Rupert Brooke, a contemporary English soldier-poet who also died in World War I. Seeger has been criticized for his impersonal, conventional, and idealizing verses, but critics acknowledge these as being the weaknesses of youth. James Hart in the Dictionary of Literary Biography explained, &ldquo;He needed more time to move from a stock and outmoded romanticism to a more distinctive and original style, from a style full of abstractions to one more concrete and personal.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe son of Charles Louis Seeger, a businessman with sugar refining concerns in Mexico, Alan Seeger was born in New York City, and grew up in a wealthy and cultured home in Staten Island. His sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Charles (who became a noted musicologist), were close in age. Seeger attended the Staten Island Academy and then the Horace Mann School in Manhattan until the age of 12. His family then moved to Mexico City; in 1902 Alan returned with his brother Charles to New York to attend the Hackley School, in Tarrytown. Following his graduation from the Hackley School, Seeger attended Harvard University, where, as a budding poet, he was influenced by the Romantic poets while other poets at Harvard, such as T.S. Eliot, were experimenting with more modern verse. He also translated Dante Alighieri&nbsp;and Ludovico Ariosto and helped edit the Harvard Monthly, in which he published many of his poems. He graduated from Harvard with a BA in 1910.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, Seeger moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. There he attempted to live out his romanticized notion of bohemian life, living wholly through the senses (as opposed to the mind). His father was not pleased with his decision to evade the pursuit of a responsible career in favor of the pursuit of beauty. Still, Seeger continued writing poetry and slept on the couch of his classmate and notorious revolutionary, John Reed. After two years Seeger decided New York did not live up to his ideals so, with funding from admiring friends, he left for Paris, France.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Seeger reveled in his new friendships among the artists in the Latin Quarter. He found his ideals of beauty embodied by the city. There is also evidence that he fell in love in the poems &ldquo;Do You Remember Once&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rendezvous,&rdquo; and also in a telegram to his father. When war broke out between France and Germany in 1914, Seeger enlisted in the French Foreign Legion to defend his beloved France.\r\n\r\nApparently seeking the utmost of excitement in life, Seeger also had a fatalistic streak, and seemed attracted to the possibility of his death. Victor Chapman, in Victor Chapman&rsquo;s Letters from France, questioned Seeger&rsquo;s emotional state before joining the Legion: &ldquo;Seeger was an appalling wreck before the war.&rdquo; In his letters, Seeger told of crowded quarters, filth, cold and misery; but only his romantic views of the war make their way into his poetry, unlike that of more realistic and anti-war poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. His admiration for Sir Philip Sidney and familiarity with the age of chivalry caused him to cast his comrades as mediaeval crusaders. Ever a fatalist, the outcome of the war was of less interest to Seeger than the glory of comradeship and adventure.\r\n\r\nSeeger&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;I Have a Rendezvous with Death&rdquo; tells of an expected meeting between the narrator and Death himself. Though the narrator of the poem regrets leaving behind life&rsquo;s pleasures and love, he does not fear or abhor death. Instead he is stoic, making the rendezvous a matter of honor. Hart described the curious relationship between the narrator and Death: &ldquo;The union of fallen soldier and Death is, unfortunately, not based upon any profound philosophical or religious belief, but upon a vague romantic fusion of nature&rsquo;s beauty, sexual love, and life in some undefined other realm.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France&rdquo; is considered less aggrandizing and egocentric, and therefore a stronger work, but &ldquo;Rendezvous&rdquo; was still more famous. In 1916, Seeger died (ironically on July 4th) in the attack on Belloy-en-Santerre, where he was shot in the stomach. Following his death, the French military awarded him the Croix de Guerre and the M&eacute;daille militaire. He was buried in a mass grave.\r\n\r\nSeeger&rsquo;s collected Poems were published in 1917 to mixed reviews. Critics often find that Seeger had not yet matured as an artist, displaying too much of his enthusiasm for the Romantic poets. Hart wrote that Seeger&rsquo;s &ldquo;view of the rightful behavior for an aesthete and poet filtered and colored his recording of his experiences.&rdquo; F.F. Kelley in Bookman found in Seeger&rsquo;s poems &ldquo;Imaginative beauty and much nobility of expression,&rdquo; but still considered the poems limited in scope: &ldquo;Their viewpoint is always that of the conventionally romantic and, fine in spirit and pleasing in form although the poems are, one looks in them in vain for any glimpse of forward shining light.&rdquo; H.F. Armstrong, in Dial, compared Seeger to his contemporary Rupert Brooke, and laments that the two poets did not live long enough to realize their potential: &ldquo;A large part of the poems in this volume can reasonably well stand on their strictly literary merits. &hellip; We like to think that if Rupert Brooke had lived he would have eliminated from his final volume some of the unnecessary gaucheries of expression, as well as some of the unworthy compositions which were rushed into print under the impulse of the sudden fame brought about by his death. The same thought occurs in the case of Alan Seeger.&rdquo; Still, Seeger&rsquo;s poetry remained popular throughout the war with soldiers in the trenches and with supporters at home.\r\n\r\nSeeger&rsquo;s Letters and Diary&nbsp;(1917) met with criticism for its impersonal tone, although some reviewers also found the book of historical interest and relevance.&nbsp;A critic at the Boston Transcript wrote, &ldquo;It is for America as well as for France that these letters speak. They come to the public eye at a most propitious moment.&rdquo; A critic writing for the Independent found the writing vivid and literary, but &ldquo;curiously impersonal. There is hardly an anecdote, hardly a mention of an individual. Idiosyncrasies of character, incidents of trench life were not his interest and yet you live trench life with him, and you breathe the very spirit of the war.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe French have particularly honored Seeger as a poet who memorialized the fighting that took place in their country during World War I, and they have published numerous tributes to him since his death. A street in Biarritz, France, was named after Seeger in the 1970s. Although, as Hart writes, &ldquo;many of [Seeger&rsquo;s] poems are now, with justice, labeled second rate,&rdquo; they are still valuable, &ldquo;as a manifestation of the idealism that swept over his generation., Alan Seeger  (22 June 1888 \u2013 4 July 1916) was an American  war poet  who fought and died in  World War I  during the  Battle of the Somme , serving in the  French Foreign Legion . Seeger was the brother of  Elizabeth Seeger , a children's author and educator, and  Charles Seeger , a noted American pacifist and musicologist; he was also the uncle of folk musicians  Pete Seeger ,  Peggy Seeger , and  Mike Seeger . He is lauded for the poem \" I Have a Rendezvous with Death \", a favorite of President  John F. Kennedy . [1]  A statue representing him is on the monument in the  Place des \u00c9tats-Unis ,  Paris , honoring those American citizens who volunteered to fight for the  Third French Republic  while their country was still neutral and lost their lives during the war. Seeger is sometimes called the \"American  Rupert Brooke \". [2]Seeger was born on June 22, 1888, in New York City. [3]  According to Alan's nephew, folk singer  Pete Seeger , the Seeger family was \"enormously Christian, in the  Puritan ,  Calvinist  New England tradition.\" [4]  In practice, though, Alan's immediate family lived within the precepts of the evolution of Calvinism into Unitarianism. His parents were married in the Unitarian Church, [5]  and Alan and his brother, Charles, were educated in schools based in Unitarianism: the Horace Mann school in Manhattan, the Hackley School in Tarrytown and Harvard University. The family traced their American heritage to the 18th century. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a doctor from  W\u00fcrttemberg , Germany, emigrated to America after the  American Revolution  and married into the old New England family of Parsons in the 1780s. [6]Alan's father,  Charles Seeger, Sr. , was influential in the late 19th century development of Mexico and its relationship with the United States through publishing, infrastructure development, and sugar refining. Alan's first years included a brief time spent in Mexico City before the family returned to live on  Staten Island , where his sister Elizabeth (Elsie) was born. Elizabeth became an author and New York City educator. Alan's older brother  Charles Seeger, Jr.  became a noted musicologist, and the father of the American folk singers Pete Seeger,  Mike Seeger , and  Peggy Seeger .Seeger's family was well-to-do, and Charles, Sr. was a figure in international commerce throughout his life. In 1898, the family moved from Staten Island to an apartment near Central Park. In 1900, Charles' business interests took the family back to Mexico City where he took a role in the development of the city's transportation infrastructure and become a merchant of electric automobiles.Young Alan's short time in Mexico provides material for his later, and longest, poem, \"The Deserted Garden\". [7]  In 1902, Seeger left Mexico City with his brother to attend  Hackley School  in Tarrytown, New York, after which he attended Harvard University. [3]  His Harvard class of 1910 included the poet  T. S. Eliot . [8]  During Seeger's first few years at Harvard, he was primarily fixated on intellectual pursuits and did not have a significant social life. However, as an upperclassman and editor at  The Harvard Monthly , he found a group of friends that shared his  aesthete  sensibilities, including  Walter Lippmann  and  John Reed . [9]  With Lippmann, he founded a  Socialist  club at Harvard to protest anti-labor policies at the university. [8]Upon graduation from Harvard, Seeger returned to Manhattan to live primarily in a boardinghouse at 61 Washington Square South that came to be known variously as The Alan Seeger House or House of Genius. Run by the Swiss \u00e9migr\u00e9 Catherine Branchard, its residents at one time or another included  Theodore Dreiser ,  Stephen Crane ,  Frank Norris ,  Robert Moses , Sydney Porter ( O. Henry ), John Reed, and other figures of American literature. [5]  While in Greenwich Village, he attended soir\u00e9es at the Petitpas Restaurant, where the artist and sage  John Butler Yeats , father of the poet  William Butler Yeats , held court. [10]  After two years, Seeger left Greenwich Village to move to Paris, where he lived in the  Latin Quarter  and continued to pursue a  bohemian  lifestyle. [3]Seeger was living on Rue du Sommerard in Paris in 1914, when  war was declared between France and Germany . He quickly volunteered to fight as a member of the  Foreign Legion  in the  French Army , stating that he was motivated by his love for France and his belief in the  Allies . [11]  For Seeger, fighting for the Allies was a moral imperative; in his poem \"A Message to America,\" he spoke out against what he saw as America's moral failure to join the war. [8]During the two years he fought in the French Foreign Legion, Seeger wrote regular dispatches to the  New York Sun , and the essay \"As A Soldier Thinks of War\" for Walter Lippman's fledgling magazine,  The New Republic  posited that though war was lamentable and the cause of death, this one was inevitable and necessary. For the most part, his poetry of that time was not well known and would not become so until after his death. [5]  His work was heavily influenced by the  Romantic school , and by the precepts of chivalry and medieval ethos of the knight. As the war progressed, the theme of death grew stronger in his poetry, culminating in what became his most famous poem, \"I Have a Rendezvous with Death.\" [12]In the winter of 1916, he developed  bronchitis  and spent several months recovering before he returned to the battlefront. [13]  He was  killed in action  in 1916, during a French attack against the  Imperial German Army  at  Belloy-en-Santerre , during the  Battle of the Somme . [14]  His fellow legionnaire, Rif Baer, later described his last moments: \"His tall silhouette stood out on the green of the cornfield. He was the tallest man in his section. His head erect, and pride in his eye, I saw him running forward, with bayonet fixed. Soon he disappeared and that was the last time I saw my friend.\" [9] [13]  After being mortally wounded in  no man's land , Seeger cheered on the passing soldiers of the Legion before he finally died from his injuries. [15]  According to one account, knowing he was mortally wounded, he killed himself with a gunshot to the head. [16]Seeger had been falsely reported dead after the  Battle of Champagne  in October 1915, in which he had fought. [9]  The news of his actual death was met with public mourning in both America and France. [17]  After the USA entered World War I,  Poems , a posthumously published collection of Seeger's war poetry, sold out six editions in a year. [12]  The poet  Edwin Arlington Robinson , who had described Seeger as \"the  Hedonist \" after meeting him in 1911, suggested that it might be best that he had died in the war, \"for I don\u2019t believe that he would ever have come anywhere near to fitting himself into this interesting but sometimes unfittable world.\" [18]It is assumed, and officially stated, that Seeger's bones rest with other dead of the Belloy-en-Santerre battle in ossuary No. 1 of the French National Cemetery in  Lihons . [19]  After his death, Seeger's parents donated a bell to a local church and planted trees in his honor. Both of their contributions to Belloy-en-Santerre were destroyed during  World War II , [17]  though the remains of the bell were combined with other metals into a new church bell, and one of the apple trees was believed to be still alive behind the village hall at Belloy en Santerre as of 2016.Seeger's poetry was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in December 1916 with a 46-page introduction by William Archer.  Poems , a collection of his works, was relatively unsuccessful, due, according to Eric Homberger, to its lofty idealism and language, qualities out of fashion in the early decades of the 20th century. [20]Poems  was reviewed in  The Egoist , where T.S. Eliot stated:Seeger was serious about his work and spent pains over it. The work is well done, and so much out of date as to be almost a positive quality. It is high-flown, heavily decorated and solemn, but its solemnity is thorough going, not a mere literary formality. Alan Seeger, as one who knew him can attest, lived his whole life on this plane, with impeccable poetic dignity; everything about him was in keeping. [21] [20]His most famous poem, \" I Have a Rendezvous with Death \", is believed to have been completed during a winter 1916 bivouac at Crevecoeur, [5]  and was published posthumously. [14] [22]  It begins,A recurrent theme in both his poetic works and his personal writings was his desire for his life to end gloriously at an early age.According to the  New York Times , \"President Kennedy had loved the poem so much that his wife  Jacqueline  memorized it at his request.\" [1]  The poem continues to resonate today and was quoted by the President of France,  Emmanuel Macron , in a speech  to the U.S. Congress in April 2018. [23]In 1919, Seeger's father Charles, while living in Paris, determined to devote royalties received for Poems and for a subsequent Letters and Diary, published in 1917, to the founding of what became the  American Library in Paris . Charles became its first board chairman.On 4 July 1923, the President of the French  Council of State ,  Raymond Poincar\u00e9 , dedicated a monument in the  Place des \u00c9tats-Unis  to the Americans who had volunteered to fight in World War I in the service of France. The monument, in the form of a bronze statue on a plinth, executed by  Jean Boucher , had been financed through a public subscription. [24]Boucher had used a photograph of Seeger as his inspiration, and Seeger's name can be found, among those of 23 others who had fallen in the ranks of the  Foreign Legion  in the  French Army  on the back of the plinth. Also, on either side of the base of the statue, are two excerpts from Seeger's \"Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France\", a poem written shortly before his death on 4 July 1916. Seeger intended that his words should be read in Paris on 30 May of that year, at an observance of the American holiday,  Decoration Day  (later known as Memorial Day):They did not pursue worldly rewards; they wanted nothing more than to live without regret, brothers pledged to the honor implicit in living one's own life and dying one's own death. Hail, brothers! Goodbye to you, the exalted dead! To you, we owe two debts of gratitude forever: the glory of having died for France, and the homage due to you in our memories.On July 3 and 4, 2016, the centennial of Seeger's death was memorialized in two separate ceremonies at the monument at Place Des \u00c9tats-Unis, and at Belloy-en-Santerre, where 500 people from the US, France, Germany and Spain gathered to commemorate his role in the liberation of the village, as well as those of German poet  Reinhard Sorge  and Catalan poet Camil Campanya, also associated with the battle.In 1921,  Alan Seeger Natural Area , in central Pennsylvania, was named by the folklorist and conservationist Colonel Henry Shoemaker in honor of Seeger. In the same year, the \"Alan Seeger Tree\" was planted and dedicated in Washington Square Park before the Branchard boarding house in an event led by poet/historian  Walter Adolphe Roberts . The tree disappeared at some point probably in the mid-century. [5]  The  liberty ship   SS  Alan Seeger , a tanker, was launched by the California Shipbuilding Corp 5 October 1943, during  World War II . [25]Author Chris Dickon wrote what is widely considered the definitive biography of Seeger in 2017,  A Rendezvous with Death: Alan Seeger in Poetry, at War . Dickon spoke about Seeger and his work at the American Library, Paris, shortly after the publication of his book. [26]Also in 2017, the oratorio  Alan Seeger: Instrument of Destiny  by American composer Patrick Zimmerli was premiered at the Cath\u00e9drale Saint Louis des Invalides in Paris, followed by an American premier at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York in 2019.On 9 November 2018, an opinion commentary by Aaron Schnoor in  The Wall Street Journal  honored the poetry of World War I, including Seeger's poem \"I Have a Rendezvous With Death\".

Born on June 22, 1888, in New York City, Seeger grew up in a wealthy and cultured home on Staten Island. His father, Charles Louis Seeger, was a successful businessman with sugar refining interests in Mexico. Seeger's early years included a brief time in Mexico City before his family returned to Staten Island, where his sister, Elizabeth, was born. She would go on to become a children's author and educator. \r\n\r\nSeeger's education began at the Staten Island Academy and the Horace Mann School in Manhattan until the age of 12, when his family moved to Mexico City. In 1902, Seeger returned to New York with his brother Charles to attend the Hackley School in Tarrytown. It was during these formative years that Seeger's interest in poetry was sparked. He went on to attend Harvard University, graduating with a BA in 1910. At Harvard, he was influenced by the Romantic poets while his peers, such as T.S. Eliot, experimented with more modern verse. He translated Dante Alighieri and Ludovico Ariosto, and his own poems were published in the Harvard Monthly, of which he was an editor. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating from Harvard, Seeger moved to Greenwich Village in New York City, where he fully embraced the bohemian lifestyle. He lived a romanticized life, pursuing beauty and sensory experiences rather than a traditional career path. This decision did not please his father, who wanted him to pursue a more responsible and stable career. Despite this, Seeger continued to write poetry and rubbed shoulders with other young bohemians, including his classmate and notorious revolutionary, John Reed. \r\n\r\nHowever, after two years, Seeger felt that New York did not live up to his ideals, so he moved to Paris with funding from his friends. In the Latin Quarter, he found his ideal of beauty and also fell in love, as evidenced in his poems \"Do You Remember Once\" and \"The Rendezvous.\" When World War I broke out in 1914, Seeger's sense of adventure and idealism led him to enlist in the French Foreign Legion to defend France, a country he had grown to love. \r\n\r\nSeeger's military service was marked by both excitement and a fatalistic streak. Victor Chapman, in his \"Letters from France,\" described Seeger as \"an appalling wreck before the war.\" Indeed, Seeger's letters home spoke of the harsh realities of war, including crowded quarters, filth, and misery. However, his poetry only reflected the romantic and chivalrous aspects of war, influenced by his admiration for Sir Philip Sidney and the age of chivalry. His most famous poem, \"I Have a Rendezvous with Death,\" personifies Death as a companion rather than something to be feared. \r\n\r\nSeeger's fatalism seemed to predict his early demise. He was killed in action on July 4, 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, shot in the stomach during an attack on Belloy-en-Santerre. Knowing he was mortally wounded, he continued to cheer on his passing comrades before he died. For his bravery, the French military awarded him the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille militaire.

From an early age, he developed a love for language and the arts, often spending his free time exploring the city's museums, theaters, and libraries.\n\nAs a young man, Ziegler attended the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he studied poetry and literature. It was during this time that he discovered the works of influential poets such as William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. These modernists, with their experimental forms and innovative use of language, left a lasting impression on Ziegler's own poetic style.\n\nZiegler's poetry is also influenced by his Jewish heritage and the rich cultural history that comes with it. He often draws on Jewish folklore, traditions, and religious themes, infusing his poetry with a sense of spirituality and a deep connection to his cultural roots.\n\nPoetic Career:\nZiegler's first collection of poems, \"The River Under the House,\" was published in 1982 and immediately garnered attention for its fresh and unique voice. In this collection, Ziegler explores themes of family, memory, and the passage of time through a series of intimate and often humorous poems. The title poem, for example, is a poignant reflection on the transience of life and the enduring power of love and family.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ziegler continued to publish widely in literary journals and magazines, solidifying his place in the literary world. His poems often feature unexpected twists and turns, blending the mundane with the fantastical. For example, his poem \"Love at First Sight,\" from his collection \"The Swan Song of Vaudeville,\" playfully explores the theme of romantic love through the lens of a circus performer, complete with tightrope walkers and a lion tamer.\n\nIn addition to his poetry, Ziegler is also known for his translations of French poets, including Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud. His translations are renowned for their accuracy and their ability to capture the musicality and essence of the original works.\n\nRecent Years and Legacy:\nIn recent years, Ziegler has continued to write and publish new work, further expanding his oeuvre. His more recent poems explore themes of aging, loss, and the natural world, all with the same wit and insight that characterizes his earlier work.\n\nZiegler's poetry has earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and the Pushcart Prize. His work has also been widely anthologized, introducing his poems to a new generation of readers.\n\nWhen not writing, Ziegler has also taught creative writing and literature at various universities, sharing his passion for poetry with his students. Through his teaching and his poetry, Ziegler has inspired countless aspiring writers and has left a lasting impact on the literary community.\n\nIn conclusion, Alan Ziegler is a poet whose work resonates with readers for its unique blend of humor, insight, and a touch of the surreal. Through his poetry, he invites us to see the world through a different lens, one that is filled with wonder, beauty, and a deep understanding of the human experience. As he continues to write and inspire, his legacy in the world of poetry is assured.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Scottish poet Alastair Reid was born in Whithorn, Galloway, Scotland, where his father was a minister. He attended the University of St. Andrews, though his education was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. He was conscripted into the navy and became a code breaker. Reid returned to St. Andrews after the war and earned a degree in classics. He soon left Scotland, embarking on the itinerant lifestyle for which he would become well known.\r\n\r\nReid first taught at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, and then traveled to Mallorca, where he befriended Robert Graves. Though their friendship ultimately soured when Reid ran away with Margot Callas, Graves&rsquo;s muse, the relationship between Graves and Reid was at first tremendously productive. Through Graves, Reid developed an interest in translating. His long immersion in the Spanish language led him to translating the poetry of a diverse group of Latin American writers, including Pablo Neruda, Jorge Luis Borges, Heberto Padilla, Eugenio Montejo, and Jos&eacute; Emilio Pachedo. Reid was a longtime contributor to the New Yorker, and his observations of Spain became the basis for his &ldquo;From a Spanish Village&rdquo; chronicle in the magazine.\r\n\r\nA minor scandal arose when Reid admitted to creating composite characters and taking other creative liberties with the column in the 1980s. Reid&rsquo;s peripatetic life included stints living in a houseboat on the Thames, on a ginger plantation in the Dominican Republic, and in an apartment in Greenwich Village.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nReid&rsquo;s poetry is known for its colloquial warmth and ease. His collections include To Lighten My House (1953), Oddments, Inklings, Omens, Moments: Poems (1959), Passwords: Places, Poems, Preoccupations (1963), and Weathering: Poems and Translations (1978), in which Reid bid farewell to &ldquo;formal poetry, which seems to me now something of an artificial gesture, like wearing a tie.&rdquo; Selected volumes of his work continued to appear, though, as An Alastair Reid Reader: Selected Prose and Poetry (1994), Oases: Poems and Prose (1997), and Inside Out: Selected Poetry and Translations (2008). Reid&rsquo;s prose is as well regarded as his poetry, and he frequently published collections that included both. Selections from his columns for the New Yorker were published as Whereabouts: Notes on Being a Foreigner (1987), and further essays, travelogues, and reminiscences were collected in Outside In: Selected Prose (2008).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReid died in 2014., Alastair Reid  (22 March 1926, in  Whithorn  \u2013 21 September 2014, in  Manhattan ) was a Scottish  poet  and a scholar of  South American literature . He was known for his lighthearted style of poems and for his translations of South American poets  Jorge Luis Borges  and  Pablo Neruda . Although he was known for translations, his own poems had gained notice during his lifetime. He had lived in  Spain ,  Switzerland ,  Greece ,  Morocco ,  Argentina ,  Mexico ,  Chile , the  Dominican Republic , and in the  United States . During the editorship of  William Shawn  he wrote for  The New Yorker  magazine, but his main income was from teaching.Reid was born at  Whithorn  in  Galloway ,  Scotland , the son of a clergyman. During the  Second World War  he served in the  Royal Navy  decoding ciphers. After the war he studied Classics at the  University of St Andrews  and briefly taught Classics at  Sarah Lawrence College , New York. In the mid-1950s he travelled to  Mallorca , spending some time working as the secretary of  Robert Graves . [1]In 1984, in an interview for  The Wall Street Journal , Reid admitted fabricating many details of his reporting from Spain for the  New Yorker , including inventing places and ascribing statements to composite characters. He said these lies were an attempt to present \"a larger truth, of which facts form a part.\" [2]  In his book,  Whereabouts , Reid counters this article with the following:These pieces were at the center of a curious storm that blew up in the American press during June of 1984. A year or so before, I had addressed a seminar at  Yale University  on the wavering line between fact and fiction, using examples from various writers, Borges among them, and from my own work. A student from the seminar went on to become a reporter and published a piece in  The Wall Street Journal  that charged me with having made a practice of distorting facts, quoting the cases I had cited in the seminar. Many newspaper editorials took up the story as though it were fact, and used it to wag pious fingers at the  New Yorker . A number of columnists reproved me for writing about an \"imaginary\" Spanish village, a charge that would have delighted the flesh-and-blood inhabitants.... Not a single one of my critics, as far as I could judge, had gone back to read the pieces in question.Reid published more than forty books of poems, translations, and travel writing, [1]  including  Ounce Dice Trice , a book of word-play and  literary nonsense  for children (illustrated by  Ben Shahn ), and two selections from his works:  Outside In: Selected Prose  and  Inside Out: Selected Poetry and Translations  (both 2008). [3]During the 1980s and 1990s Reid spent much of his time on a ginger plantation in  Saman\u00e1 ,  Dominican Republic , until 2003 when tourism boomed in the area. [4] [5] [6]Reid died on 21 September 2014, aged 88, due to a gastric bleed during treatment for pneumonia. [7] [8] [9]  He is survived by his children, Michael Reid Hunter, and Jasper Reid, and his wife Leslie Clark. [10].",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: On January 31, 1948, Albert Goldbarth was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received his BA from the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle campus, in 1969 and his MFA from the University of Iowa in 1971. He taught at the Elgin Community College in Chicago until 1972 and as a coordinator for the Traveling Writers Workshop for public schools in the Chicago area.In 1974, he completed a year of classes at the University of Utah while working toward his PhD in creative writing. Over a year's time, Goldbarth received the Poetry Northwest Theodore Roethke Prize, published a chapbook, Under Cover, and had completed two full-length poetry collections, Coprolites and Opticks (published in 1974). He left Utah early to pursue a teaching career and worked briefly at Cornell and Syracuse Universities before moving to the University of Texas, Austin, where he taught from 1977 to 1987.Since then, he has published more than twenty-five collections of poetry, includingTo Be Read in 500 Years: Poems (Graywolf Press, 2009); The Kitchen Sink: New and Selected Poems 1972-2007 (2007); Saving Lives (2001) and Heaven and Earth: A Cosmology (1991), both of which won the National Book Critics Circle award for poetry (Goldbarth is the only poet to have received the award twice); Popular Culture (1990), which received the Ohio State University Press / The Journal Award; and Jan. 31 (1974), which was nominated in 1975 for the National Book Award.When asked about the \"job of poetry,\" Goldbarth told The Missouri Review, \"It's not my place to define the job of poetry, but a lot of my poems do try to serve as memorials, as segments of frozen time that save people or cultural moments that have otherwise passed away or are in danger of passing away.\"Goldbarth was invited to edit Every Pleasure: The \"Seneca Review\" Long Poem Anthology (1979). He has also written several collections of essays, including Many Circles (Graywolf Press, 2001), winner of the PEN West Creative Nonfiction Award, A Sympathy of Souls (1990) and Great Topics of the World (1994), and a novel, Pieces of Payne (Graywolf Press, 2001). His work has been featured in numerous anthologies, including The Harvard Book of Contemporary Poetry (Harvard University Press, 1985).About his work, the critic Helen Vendler has said, \"Half of Goldbarth's imagination . . . is what is usually called religious. Goldbarth's tenderness toward the mystical does not, however, vitiate his enormous curiosity, or the momentum of his zest, or his sympathy of souls with the historical personages he resuscitates. . . . His rhetoric is eager to mirror the number of things the world is full of, the unexpected fulfillments it holds in its arms.\"Goldbarth's honors include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. He was also named to the arts advisory board of the Judah L. Magnes Jewish Museum in Berkeley, California, in 1999.He is Adele Davis Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Wichita State University, where he has taught since 1987.

Life in poetry is a free newsletter for poetry publications and allpoetry is a free community to encourage &amp; educate poets.  Contact us for more info or to be an allpoetry mentor., Acclaimed for its dense, expansive form and linguistic energy, Albert Goldbarth&rsquo;s poetry covers everything from historical and scientific concerns to private and ordinary matters. His numerous highly-regarded collections are often filled with long poems which range in style from playful and conversational to serious and philosophical. Goldbarth&rsquo;s unique style is a mix of complex ideas, juxtapositions between dissimilar objects and facts, and detailed descriptions woven together with verbal play. Goldbarth &ldquo;has that rare gift of seeing metaphor in almost any event, of discovering a poem in the most unlikely places,&rdquo; wrote Robert Cording in the&nbsp;Carolina Quarterly. Eric McHenry, writing for&nbsp;Slate, noted that Goldbarth distinguishes himself from nearly all his contemporaries by writing in a style that is &ldquo;effusive, sprawling, and instantly recognizable&mdash;an aesthetic that might best be characterized as &lsquo;Why use one word when four will work just as well?&rsquo; His poems do lack concentration in the most obvious sense of the word, but they make up for it with the other kind. Goldbarth pays rapt attention to the world around him, drawing one memorable connection after another.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGoldbarth is a prolific writer who has published over 20 collections of poetry, a handful of essay collections, and a novel. His ravenously attentive style can be seen even in his earliest collections,&nbsp;Opticks: A Poem in Seven Sections&nbsp;(1974)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Comings Back&nbsp;(1976). The topics and places covered in&nbsp;Opticks&nbsp;range far and wide&mdash;encompassing the Illinois tollway, World War II, and Middle Age glass makers&mdash;and are used to create an array of dramatic monologues. Goldbarth&rsquo;s next collection Comings Back: A Sequence of Poems, focuses on returns. The book, remarked Victor Contoski in&nbsp;Prairie Schooner,&nbsp;&ldquo;suggests an interesting perspective in which everything is seen from the original place, the original time &hellip; Goldbarth speaks of the poet as a maker of lists, and in effect the entire book is a list of various comings back, often in surprising contexts.&rdquo;&nbsp;Comings Back&nbsp;makes its impression as a whole, though it is full of disparate dreams and anecdotes, as well as jokes, personal letters, and quotations from a wide variety of sources. The separate parts of&nbsp;Different Fleshes&nbsp;(1979) are also closely related, tied together by perambulations of their cross-dressing main character, Vander Clyde/Barbette. The narrative travels from Paris to Texas, eventually focusing on present-day Austin and its contemporary gay bars. The book presents a circular structure of metamorphoses through the character of Vander Clyde/Barbette. &ldquo;Different Fleshes&nbsp;is a work partly about the distance linking the past and present, more particularly about choices made which separate one sort of future from another,&rdquo; wrote&nbsp;American Poetry Review&nbsp;contributor Michael King.\r\n\r\nOriginal Light: New and Selected Poems 1973-1983&nbsp;(1983) presents a wide selection of poems arranged thematically into three sections.&nbsp;Diane Wakoski, writing in the&nbsp;American Book Review,&nbsp;saw the main theme of the book as &ldquo;what seeing really is and what really seeing is. [Goldbarth] explores light as the source of everything and like many philosophers looks for the original light, the source of everything in paradox and the paradoxes of physics.&rdquo; Goldbarth&rsquo;s &ldquo;personae include adolescent lovers, masochistic slaves, aphoristic fabulists, philosophical plumbers, and semi-literate students,&rdquo; wrote Michael Simms in the&nbsp;Southwest Review.&nbsp;&ldquo;He fashions metaphors from the deductions of historians, theologians, and physicists, integrating their arguments into poems which remain, somehow, intensely personal and concrete.&rdquo; Simms concluded: &ldquo;His ability to see and to see again encourages us to observe the world more closely and to take courage from the small happenings of our profoundly ordinary lives.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGoldbarth has published numerous volumes of poetry and essays since&nbsp;Original Light&nbsp;and twice been awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award, for&nbsp;Heaven and Earth: A Cosmology&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;and&nbsp;Saving Lives&nbsp;(2001).&nbsp;Heaven and Earth&nbsp;outlines narratives about Goldbarth&rsquo;s father and his German relatives, and examines the many ways humans seek to communicate in spite of the numerous obstacles thrown in the way.&nbsp;Saving Lives, a&nbsp;Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly&nbsp;reviewer noted &ldquo;repeats motifs detection and detective stories, radio, Rembrandt, aged relatives; these motifs let many poems focus on questions about dual, or hidden, identities or lives.&rdquo; Though his output is immense, and the breadth of his interest and knowledge astounding, Goldbarth&rsquo;s books rarely innovate on his basic style of gregarious, tender, and rambunctious prose-like lines, sometimes dismissed as &ldquo;lineated essays.&rdquo; But though the poetry doesn&rsquo;t look or sound like much contemporary verse, which often depends on sparseness and a self-consciously elevated diction for its effects, Goldbarth&rsquo;s champions insist that his poetry actually shows a kind of expansive concentration, his language a sort of effusive distillation. In his review for&nbsp;Slate, Eric McHenry noted that &ldquo;in spite of this omnivorousness, the poems aren&rsquo;t just big maximalist messes. Synthesis is Goldbarth&rsquo;s goal, and his gift.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nPerhaps in homage to that &ldquo;omnivorousness,&rdquo; Goldbarth titled his next collection of selected poems, his first in 14 years,&nbsp;The Kitchen Sink: New and Selected Poems 1972-2007&nbsp;(2007). Reviewing the retrospective,&nbsp;Judith Kitchen&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Georgia Review&nbsp;described Goldbarth as &ldquo;the American poet of his generation for the ages. Often humorous but always serious, Goldbarth combines erudite research, pop-culture fanaticism, and personal anecdote in ways that make his writings among the most stylistically recognizable in the literary world.&rdquo; Goldbarth&rsquo;s distinctive style has sometimes drawn criticism for just those things which distinguish it: sociability, exuberance, and a certain amount of catholicity. Reviewing&nbsp;Budget Travel through Space and Time&nbsp;(2005) for&nbsp;Poetry,&nbsp;D.H. Tracy&nbsp;quipped that &ldquo;Goldbarth&rsquo;s work amounts to a poetry of lists, and, as some have pointed out, such a poetry has trouble outdoing itself &hellip; There can&rsquo;t be any meaning in the connections the poems draw when it is practically a premise that connections can be drawn between anything.&rdquo; But reviewers and readers alike continue to appreciate Goldbarth&rsquo;s poetry for its erudition, humor and insight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to poetry, Goldbarth has also written volumes of essays, including&nbsp;A Sympathy of Souls&nbsp;(1990),&nbsp;Great Topics of the World&nbsp;(1996) and&nbsp;Many Circles: New and Selected Essays&nbsp;(2001).&nbsp;Goldbarth&rsquo;s essays cover subject matter that will be familiar to readers of his poetry: history, science, pop culture and autobiography. In&nbsp;A Sympathy of Souls,&nbsp;Goldbarth makes connections between seemingly unrelated topics (such as God and Mickey Mouse), demonstrating again and again how the past and present, the mundane and cosmic, continually connect and combine.&nbsp;Many Circles&nbsp;received high praise from all corners. The&nbsp;New York Times Book Review&nbsp;admitted that &ldquo;Goldbarth is indeed addressing some of the greatest topics there are, and he handles them splendidly &hellip; with humor, intelligence and grace,&rdquo; and&nbsp;Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly&nbsp;put him in &ldquo;the company of America&rsquo;s premiere literary essayists, somewhere between Annie Dillard and David Foster Wallace.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThough his volumes of essays and his novel,&nbsp;Pieces of Payne&nbsp;(2003) a gallimaufry of history, science, romance and current events, have all been critically lauded, Goldbarth remains most noted for his poetry. The&nbsp;New York Times Book Review&nbsp;contributor Phillip Lopate contended that Goldbarth&rsquo;s &ldquo;poems are so complex and omnivorous that even when they don&rsquo;t quite succeed, you have to admire them. In a typical performance, he will juggle many different ideas and images, not only keeping them all in the air but establishing surprising connections among them that yield a large general meaning.&rdquo; Goldbarth himself has said that he believes he&rsquo;s &ldquo;writing a poem that&rsquo;s probably Newtonian. It believes in counterbalance. It believes in an energy that can neither be created nor destroyed, and in the recycling of that energy inside of a viable and holistic system.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAlbert Goldbarth has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation. His poetry has been nominated for the National Book Award and the&nbsp;Los Angeles Times&nbsp;Book Prize. In 2008 he was awarded the Mark Twain Poetry Award from the Poetry Foundation. Goldbarth has taught for many years at Wichita State University, where he is the Adele Davis Distinguished Professor of Humanities.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;, Albert Goldbarth  (born January 31, 1948) is an  American poet .

He taught at Cornell University and the University of Texas at Austin before settling at Wichita State University, where he taught for over thirty years as the Adele Davis Distinguished Professor of Humanities. Goldbarth's poetry is known for its dense, expansive form and linguistic energy, covering everything from historical and scientific concerns to private and ordinary matters. He is often praised for his unique style, which mixes complex ideas, juxtapositions between dissimilar objects and facts, and detailed descriptions woven together with verbal play. This style has been described as \"effusive, sprawling, and instantly recognizable,\" with Goldbarth paying \"rapt attention to the world around him, drawing one memorable connection after another.\"\r\n\r\nOver his prolific career, Goldbarth has published over thirty collections of poetry, including \"Opticks: A Poem in Seven Sections\" (1974), \"Comings Back: A Sequence of Poems\" (1976), \"Different Fleshes\" (1979), and \"Original Light: New and Selected Poems 1973-1983\" (1983). He has also written several essay collections, such as \"A Sympathy of Souls\" (1990) and \"Many Circles: New and Selected Essays\" (2001), and a novel, \"Pieces of Payne\" (2003). Goldbarth's work often blends history, science, pop culture, and autobiography, making connections between seemingly unrelated topics. His poetry has been described as \"Newtonian,\" believing \"in an energy that can neither be created nor destroyed, and in the recycling of that energy inside of a viable and holistic system.\"\r\n\nGoldbarth has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the National Book Critics Circle Award for \"Saving Lives\" (2001) and \"Heaven and Earth: A Cosmology\" (1991), making him the only poet to receive this award twice. He also received the Mark Twain Award for Humorous Poetry from the Poetry Foundation in 2008 and has been a fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In addition to his writing, Goldbarth is known for his dedication to teaching and has taught creative writing workshops across the country. He currently lives in Wichita, Kansas, and continues to write and publish new work.\r\n\r\nAlbert Goldbarth's poetry is a testament to the power of language and the human imagination.

His honors including six Pushcart Prizes, the Arizona Governor&#39;s Arts Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;R&iacute;os&rsquo;s poetry is a kind of magical storytelling, and his stories are a kind of magical poetry,&rdquo; commented Jos&eacute; David Sald&iacute;var in the Dictionary of Literary Biography. R&iacute;os grew up in a Spanish-speaking family but was forced to speak English in school, leading him to develop a third language, &ldquo;one that was all our own,&rdquo; as he described it. R&iacute;os once commented, &ldquo;I have been around other languages all my life, particularly Spanish, and have too often thought of the act of translation as simply giving something two names. But it is not so, not at all. Rather than filling out, a second name for something pushes it forward, forward and backward, and gives it another life.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSald&iacute;var wrote of R&iacute;os, &ldquo;Many of his important early poems dramatize the essence of this uncanny third language.&rdquo; There are examples of these in the prize-winning collection Whispering to Fool the Wind, which contains poems that Mary Logue, writing in the Voice Literary Supplement, called &ldquo;written miracles&rdquo; that &ldquo;carry the feel of another world.&rdquo; These poems, she noted, are informed by his upbringing in the border town of Nogales, Arizona, &ldquo;where one is neither in this country nor the other.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSald&iacute;var explained that R&iacute;os tells stories in verse, something that many writers have been unable to do successfully. R&iacute;os, however, is able to bring to life characters such as a man who dies of anger when a seamstress refuses to give him pins with which to display his butterfly collection. &ldquo;Throughout Whispering to Fool the Wind magical-realist events are related with the greatest of accuracy without being forced on the reader,&rdquo; Sald&iacute;var wrote. &ldquo;It is left up to readers to interpret things for themselves in a way that is most familiar to them.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSald&iacute;var deemed &ldquo;Nani,&rdquo; about R&iacute;os&rsquo;s grandmother, the best poem in the collection &ldquo;and one of the most remarkable poems in Chicano literature.&rdquo; It &ldquo;captures the reality of the invented third language,&rdquo; he said, with lines such as &ldquo;&lsquo;To speak, now-foreign words I used to speak, too, dribble down her mouth. ... By the stove she does something with words and looks at me only with her back.&rsquo;&rdquo; Logue also praised the poet&rsquo;s unusual use of language, observing that &ldquo;R&iacute;os&rsquo;s tongue is both foreign and familiar, but always enchanting.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn Five Indiscretions, &ldquo;most of the poems achieve a level of excellence not far below the peak moments of [R&iacute;os&rsquo;s] earlier poetry,&rdquo; Sald&iacute;var asserted. Almost all of these poems deal with romantic and sexual relationships between men and women, with the poet taking both male and female viewpoints. This collection has &ldquo;regrettably ... not received the acclaim and attention it deserves,&rdquo; Sald&iacute;var opined. &ldquo;The few book reviews, however, praised his ability to represent gender issues and his use of the American language.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nR&iacute;os&rsquo;s award-winning book of short stories, The Iguana Killer: Twelve Stories of the Heart, contains tales &ldquo;explor[ing] the luminous world of his childhood and border culture,&rdquo; Sald&iacute;var related. The title story centers on a young Mexican boy who uses a baseball bat to become his country&rsquo;s leading iguana killer. &ldquo;The Birthday of Mrs. Pineda&rdquo; is about an oppressed wife who finally gets a chance to speak for herself. This and &ldquo;The Way Spaghetti Feels&rdquo; are, in Sald&iacute;var&rsquo;s estimate, &ldquo;the best stories in the book&rdquo;; he commented that they &ldquo;border on the metafictional and magical-realist impulse in postmodern fiction.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThese characteristics also are evident in the 1995 work Pig Cookies and Other Stories, set in a small Mexican town where cookies exhibit supernatural powers and life takes other surprising twists and turns. &ldquo;The tales in this collection glisten with a magical sheen, at once other-worldly and real,&rdquo; remarked Greg Sanchez in World Literature Today. &ldquo;R&iacute;os takes us from the realm of imagination to the concrete and back again with surprising fluidity.&rdquo; R&iacute;os also creates winning characters, wrote a Publishers Weekly reviewer: &ldquo;These poignant, funny tales of the rich, unsuspected lives of regular folks transcend time and place.&rdquo; R&iacute;os&rsquo;s The Curtain of Trees: Stories focuses on residents of small towns along the border of Arizona and Mexico. A Publishers Weekly critic stated that the &ldquo;characters are from another era (circa the 1950s), roaming the unpaved streets of small villages, their lives made vividly real through the author&rsquo;s powerful sensitivity and sharp eye for detail.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCapirotada: A Nogales Memoir, &ldquo;a monologue that is funny, intimate, and as sweet as a candy placed in your palm by a friend,&rdquo; according to Booklist critic GraceAnne A. DeCandido, appeared in 1999. In Capirotada, R&iacute;os describes his experiences growing up in Nogales, Arizona, which shared a border with its sister city of Nogales, Mexico. A Publishers Weekly reviewer called the work &ldquo;an extremely personal family history filled with small anecdotes and finely drawn landscapes.&rdquo; In Library Journal, Gwen Gregory remarked, &ldquo;This well-balanced narrative recalls the universal experiences of childhood and unique personal reminiscences of the author.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe Smallest Muscle in the Human Body, a 2002 collection of poems, &ldquo;focuses squarely on childhood experiences and memories,&rdquo; noted a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Poems like &ldquo;My Chili&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chinese Food in the Fifties&rdquo; celebrate local dining customs, and &ldquo;Gray Dogs&rdquo; is one of several poems that contain animal imagery. According to Robert Murray Davis in World Literature Today, R&iacute;os &ldquo;is most successful ... when, on the one hand, he does not strive too hard for paradox and, on the other, when he does not take refuge in mere nostalgia.&rdquo; The book&rsquo;s title, taken from the poem &ldquo;Some Extensions on the Sovereignty of Science,&rdquo; refers to the stapedius muscle in the ear, which prevents humans from hearing their own heartbeat. &ldquo;The muscle does important work I think, but at the same time, it keeps us from something that belongs to us,&rdquo; R&iacute;os told Leslie A. Wootten in World Literature Today. &ldquo;We are protected from particular sounds for our own good. There are many things in life we are protected from hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and feeling. In large measure, the poems in this book&mdash;and all my books&mdash;struggle to bring into view what we&rsquo;ve been protected from experiencing. But by this, I mean the small things as well as the large.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOne of Chicano culture&rsquo;s important voices, R&iacute;os is dedicated &ldquo;to finding, declaring, and celebrating the diversity and power of community in the experience of those around him. Thus, his vision is more outward directed, less private than might at first glance be apparent,&rdquo; contended Robert McDowell in an essay for Contemporary Poets. Sald&iacute;var added that &ldquo;R&iacute;os is surely one of the major vernacular voices in the postmodern age.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSince 1982, R&iacute;os has taught at Arizona State University, where he is Regents Professor of English and director of the Virginia G. Piper Center for Creative Writing.&nbsp;In 2013 he was named Arizona&rsquo;s first poet laureate.

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Alden Nowlan left school before graduating and during his adolescent years worked at a variety of jobs, all of them menial, manual, or both. He was a pulp cutter, a farmhand, a sawmill worker, a night watchman, a ditch digger and a logger. Primarily self-educated, he later went on to work as a newspaperman, and published poetry, plays, short stories, and novels. \n\nBorn on January 25, 1933 at Windsor, Novia Scotia, he is widely recognized as one of the most important poets to appear in Canada in the last thirty years. His poetry collection Bread, Wine and Salt won the Governor\u2019s General award in 1967. Much of his work reflects his regional roots and an affection for the ordinary people. He died in Fredericton June 27, 1983.\n\nBibliography and image source: Univ. Of Calgary and aldennowlan.ca, Alden Albert Nowlan  ( / \u02c8 n o\u028a l \u0259 n / ; January 25, 1933 \u2013 June 27, 1983) was a Canadian  poet ,  novelist , and  playwright .Alden Nowlan was born into rural poverty in  Stanley, Nova Scotia , adjacent to  Mosherville , and close to the small town of  Windsor ,  Nova Scotia , along a stretch of dirt road that he would later refer to as Desolation Creek. His father, Freeman Lawrence Nowlan, worked sporadically as a manual labourer.His mother, Grace Reese, was only 14 years of age when Nowlan was born, and she soon left the family, leaving Alden and her younger daughter Harriet to the care of their paternal grandmother. The family discouraged education as a waste of time, and Nowlan left school after only four grades. At the age of 14, he went to work in the village sawmill. At the age of 16, he discovered the new library in Windsor. Often on weekends he would travel eighteen miles to the library to get books, which broadened his already keen reading.  \"I wrote (as I read) in secret.\" Nowlan remembered. \"My father would as soon have seen me wear lipstick.\"At 19, Nowlan's artfully embroidered r\u00e9sum\u00e9 landed him a job with  Observer , a newspaper in Hartland, New Brunswick. While working at the  Observer , Nowlan began writing books of poetry, the first of which was published by  Fredericton 's  Fiddlehead Poetry Books .Nowlan eventually settled permanently in  New Brunswick . In 1963, he married Claudine Orser, a typesetter on his former paper, and moved to  Saint John  with her and her son, John, whom he adopted. He became the night editor for the Saint John  Telegraph Journal  and continued to write poetry. In 1966, Nowlan was diagnosed with throat cancer. After three surgeries and a subsequent radiation treatment, his health began to improve. He wrote poems about his brush with death. In 1967, he was awarded a  Guggenheim Fellowship , and his collection  Bread, Wine and Salt  was awarded the  Governor General's Award for Poetry . Soon afterward, the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton offered him the position of Writer-in-Residence. He remained in the position until his death on June 27, 1983, after collapsing at his home with severe emphysema. [1]Nowlan's most notable literary achievements include the  Governor General's Award  for  Bread, Wine and Salt  (1967) and a  Guggenheim Fellowship . He was writer-in-residence at the  University of New Brunswick  in Fredericton from 1968 until his death in 1983. [2]  In New Brunswick, the Alden Nowlan Award for Excellence in English-language Literary Arts is named in his honour.Nowlan is one of Canada's most popular 20th-century poets, and his appearance in the anthology  Staying Alive  (2002) has helped to spread his popularity beyond Canada.In the 1970s, Nowlan met and became close friends with theatre director  Walter Learning . The two collaborated on a number of plays, including  A Gift to Last ,  Frankenstein ,  The Dollar Woman , and  The Incredible Murder of Cardinal Tosca.Nowlan's Fredericton home is now the residence of the Graduate Student Association at the University of New Brunswick. Dubbed \"Windsor Castle\" by Nowlan after its location on Windsor Street, the simple building is now officially called the Alden Nowlan House.Nowlan is buried in the Poets' Corner of the Forest Hill cemetery in Fredericton, New Brunswick..",

        "reflected_response": "\nEzra Weston Loomis Pound, or simply Ezra Pound, was an influential modernist poet and critic. Born in Hailey, Idaho, in 1885, Pound is known for his contributions to poetry, which often challenged traditional verse and promoted a new approach to rhythm and imagery. Pound's work displays a vast array of interests, including economics, music, and East Asian culture, reflecting his well-travelled life and diverse intellectual pursuits. \n\nOne of Pound's most distinctive characteristics is his experimentation with form. He pioneered a technique called \"imagism,\" which emphasizes the use of precise imagery and clear, sharp language, unadorned by unnecessary words. This style can be seen in his famous poem \"In a Station of the Metro,\" where he captures a fleeting moment of beauty in just 14 words: \n\n\"The appearance of these faces in the crowd; \n\nFlowers in a wet black bough.\" \n\nPound's interest in economics and politics, however, would ultimately lead to a dark chapter in his life. He became increasingly vocal about his anti-Semitic and fascist views, which aligned with Benito Mussolini's regime in Italy, where he lived during the 1920s and 1930s. His controversial beliefs, along with his use of anti-American rhetoric during World War II, resulted in a treason charge and incarceration in St. Elizabeths Hospital, a mental health institution in Washington, D.C., from 1945 to 1958. \n\nDespite this controversial period, Pound's influence on literature is undeniable. He played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of fellow modernist writers, including T.S. Eliot and James Joyce, and his literary innovations continue to inspire poets today. Additionally, Pound was a talented musician, playing the piano and composing music for his own poems. His knowledge of music deeply informed his poetry, often manifesting as an attention to rhythm and sound patterns. \n\nAn interesting fact about Pound is that he was a mentor to composer George Antheil, who is known for his experimental and avant-garde music. Pound collaborated with Antheil on a variety of projects, including the creation of a mechanized orchestra, demonstrating his fascination with merging art and technology. \n\nIn conclusion, Ezra Pound, a poet of remarkable versatility and innovation, left an indelible mark on the literary world. His experimentation with form and rhythm, combined with his incorporation of diverse interests and influences, expanded the boundaries of poetry and solidified his place as one of the foremost literary figures of the 20th century."

Barred from attending public school or university because of his religion, Pope was largely self-educated. He taught himself French, Italian, Latin, and Greek, and read widely, discovering Homer at the age of six.At twelve, Pope composed his earliest extant work, Ode to Solitude; the same year saw the onset of the debilitating bone deformity that would plague Pope until the end of his life. Originally attributed to the severity of his studies, the illness is now commonly accepted as Pott\u2019s disease, a form of tuberculosis affecting the spine that stunted his growth\u2014Pope\u2019s height never exceeded four and a half feet\u2014and rendered him hunchbacked, asthmatic, frail, and prone to violent headaches. His physical appearance would make him an easy target for his many literary enemies in later years, who would refer to the poet as a \u201chump-backed toad.\u201dPope\u2019s Pastorals, which he claimed to have written at sixteen, were published in Jacob Tonson\u2019s Poetical Miscellanies of 1710 and brought him swift recognition. Essay on Criticism, published anonymously the year after, established the heroic couplet as Pope\u2019s principal measure and attracted the attention of Jonathan Swift and John Gay, who would become Pope\u2019s lifelong friends and collaborators. Together they formed the Scriblerus Club, a congregation of writers endeavoring to satirize ignorance and poor taste through the invented figure of Martinus Scriblerus, who would serve as a precursor to the dunces in Pope's late masterpiece, the Dunciad.In 1712, the The Rape of the Lock, Pope's best-known work and the one that secured his fame, was published. Its mundane subject\u2014the true account of a squabble between two prominent Catholic families over the theft of a lock of hair\u2014is transformed by Pope into a mock-heroic send-up of classical epic poetry.Turning from satire to scholarship, Pope, in 1713, began work on his six-volume translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad. He arranged for the work to be available by subscription, with a single volume being released each year for six years, a model that garnered Pope enough money to be able to live off his work alone, one of the few English poets in history to have been able to do so.In 1719, following the death of his father, Pope moved to an estate at Twickenham, where he would live for the remainder of his life. Here he constructed his famous grotto, and went on to translate the Odyssey\u2014which he brought out under the same subscription model as the Iliad\u2014and to compile a heavily-criticized edition of Shakespeare, in which Pope \u201ccorrected\u201d the Bard\u2019s meter and made several alterations to the text, while leaving corruptions in earlier editions intact.Critic and scholar Lewis Theobald\u2019s repudiation of Pope\u2019s Shakespeare provided the catalyst for his Dunciad, a vicious, four-book satire in which Pope lampoons the witless critics and scholars of his day, presenting their \u201cabuses of learning\u201d as a mock-Aeneid, with the dunces in service to the goddess Dulness; Theobald served as its hero.Though published anonymously, there was little question as to its authorship. Reaction to the Dunciad from its victims and sympathizers was more hostile than that of any of his previous works; Pope reportedly would not leave his house without two loaded pistols in his pocket. \u201cI wonder he is not thrashed,\u201d wrote William Broome, Pope\u2019s former collaborator on the Odyssey who found himself lambasted in the Dunciad, \u201cbut his littleness is his protection; no man shoots a wren.\u201dPope published Essay on Man in 1734, and the following year a scandal broke out when an apparently unauthorized and heavily sanitized edition of Pope\u2019s letters was released by the notoriously reprobate publisher Edmund Curll (collections of correspondence were rare during the period). Unbeknownst to the public, Pope had edited his letters and delivered them to Curll in secret.Pope\u2019s output slowed after 1738 as his health, never good, began to fail. He revised and completed the Dunciad, this time substituting the famously inept Colley Cibber\u2014at that time, the country\u2019s poet laureate\u2014for Theobald in the role of chief dunce. He began work on an epic in blank verse entitled Brutus, which he quickly abandoned; only a handful of lines survive. Alexander Pope died at Twickenham, surrounded by friends, on May 30, 1744.Since his death, Pope has been in a constant state of reevaluation. His high artifice, strict prosody, and, at times, the sheer cruelty of his satire were an object of derision for the Romantic poets of the nineteenth century. It was not until the 1930s that his reputation was revived. Pope is now considered the dominant poetic voice of his century, a model of prosodic elegance, biting wit, and an enduring, demanding moral force.Born around 1753, Phillis Wheatley was the first black poet in America to publish a book.Charles Martin was born in New York City in 1942 and grewBorn in 1947 in Buffalo, New York, Molly Peacock is the author of several collections of poetry, including\u00a0The Second Blush: Poems\u00a0(W. W. Norton, 2008).Born in the Bronx on June 12, 1954, Donald Revell is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including My Mojave., Alexander Pope (May 21, 1688 - May 30, 1744), was called \"The Wicked Wasp of Twickenham\" for his stinging literary satires of his fellow writers. He modelled himself after the great Classical poets, such as Homer and Virgil, and wrote in a highly polished verse, often in a didactic or satirical vein. The greatest poet genius of his day, he perfected the heroic couplet, which is still in use today. Because of a spinal deformity from childhood, he was only 4'6\" tall. Alexander Pope was born on 21st May, 1688, in Lombard Street, London.\u00a0 From the day of his birth Pope was weak and sickly in body; and the extreme sensibility of his nerves, the feebleness of his digestive organs, and the general fragility of his constitution, made his life, in Dr. Johnson's phrase, a long disease.\u00a0 In boyhood he nearly sank under the influence of an uncontrollable hypochondria; in middle age he was dependent for ordinary comfort on the constant care of women. He was bald and deformed and almost a dwarf. \n\nAt the age of five he had already displayed sufficient signs of promise to be chosen by an aunt as the reversionary legatee of all her books, pictures and medals.\u00a0 His education in its beginnings and progress corresponds very closely with its ultimate results. Pope was by necessity rather than choice a self-educated man; and he never became a scholar.\u00a0 He taught himself writing by copying from printed books, and hence acquired the practice of minute calligraphy crowded into nooks and corners of paper -- a practice which afterwards in Pope's case almost developed intself into a mania and obtained for him from Swift the epithet of 'paper-sparing' Pope.\u00a0 From the family priest, whose name was Banister, he learnt the accidence of Latin and Greek, when 8 years of age; and afterwards successively attended two small Catholic schools, one at Twyford near Winchester, which he is said to have left in disgrace, and the other in London, kept by a convert of the name of Deane.\u00a0 About this time must be dated the famous incident of the boy Pope's visit to Will's Coffee-House, the sole occasion (according to his account to Spence) on which he ever beheld Dryden.\n\nQuitting Mr. Deane's seminary for his father's house at Binfield, Pope, now 12 or 13 years of age. At about eight years of age he had translated part of Statius, who next to Virgil continued through life his favourite Latin poet; and at 12 he had composed a play founded on the \"Iliad.\"\u00a0 At Twyford he had prepared himself for this effort by the study of Ogilby's Homer, followed by that of Sandys' Ovid; and now that he was left to follow his own inclinations, his studies continued to pursue the same direction. \"Considering,\" he told Spence, \"how very little I had when I came from school, I think I may be said to have taught myself Latin, as well as French, or Greek; and in all these my chief way of getting them was by translation.\" \n\nAlexander Pope's literary career began in 1704, when the playwright William Wycherley, pleased by Pope's verse, introduced him into the circle of fashionable London wits and writers, who welcomed him as a prodigy. He first attracted public attention in 1709 with his Pastorals. In 1711 his Essay on Criticism, a brilliant exposition of the canons of taste, was published. His most famous poem, The Rape of the Lock (first published 1712; revised edition published 1714), a fanciful and ingenious mock-heroic work based on a true story, established his reputation securely. In 1713 Pope published Windsor Forest, which endeared him to the Tories by referring to the Peace of Utrecht. In 1714 his work \u201cThe Wife of Bath\u201d appeared, which, like his \u201cThe Temple of Fame\u201d (1715), was imitative of the works of the same title by the 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. In 1717 a collection of Pope's works containing the most noteworthy of his lyrics was published. Pope's translation of Homer's Iliad was published in six volumes from 1715 to 1720; a translation of the Odyssey followed (1725-1726). He also published an edition of Shakespeare's plays (1725).\n\nHis first acquaintance with Swift connects itself with the publication of \"Windsor Forest\" early in 1713.\u00a0 In the summer of the same year Swift returned to Ireland, after performing services of inestimable value to the Tory party, but disappointed in his just hopes of episcopal preferment. Later in the year he paid another visit to England, in order to heal if he could the breach widening from day to day between the Tory chiefs Oxford and Bolingbroke.\u00a0 In the succeeding winter commenced a correspondence between him and Pope which was continued for a quarter of a century. \n\nIn 1714 Pope had published specimen passages from the Odyssey in one of Lintot's \"Miscellanies;\" and soon afterwards, and during the greater part of the following year, he was engaged upon the translation of the Iliad.\u00a0 In the autumn of 1714, he visited Oxford in order to benefit by her libraries, and in 1715 the subscribers received their copies of the first four books.\u00a0 The volumes completing the Iliad were published in 1717, '18 and '20; and the stamp of completeness set upon the whole by the well-known dedication to Congreve.\u00a0 The translation of the Odyssey occupied Pope and his conductors from 1723 to '25, by which latter year the whole work (including the Batrachomyomachia by Parnell) had been absolved. The proceeds of the Iliad brought to Pope a sum exceeding \u00a35000, even after deducting the payments for the assistance which he had received in the notes. The \"Odyssey\" produced between \u00a33000 and \u00a34000 in addition, in which are not comprehended the sums paid to Fenton and Broome, who had contributed half the work.\u00a0 Pope's dealings with his coajutors, like most othe pecuniary transactions of his life, have been exposed to much angry comment. \n\nSoon after the publication of the first volume of Homer, he removed with his parents from Binfield to Chiswick, where they settled in the spring of 1716, for a sojourn which was not to extend over more than a couple of years. By this time Pope had already become a welcome guest in the fashionable circles of the metropolis and its vicinity.\u00a0 The death of his father took place at Chiswick in October 1717. The blow was keenly felt. Very soon after his father's death Pope removed with his mother from Chiswick to Twickenham, early in 1718, after purchasing the lease of a house and five acres of land on the banks of the Thames. The house itself he left very much the simple habitation he had found it; but the garden and grounds he laid out with enthusiastic care. Landscape gardening was one of the passions of the age; and or horticulture in general Pope had conceived a taste from the days of his childhood on the borders of Windsor Forest.\u00a0 The Twickenham grotto and gardens he created became one of the delights of his life. It was here that the Iliad was completed; and henceforth Pope's name was eagerly sought by the booksellers.\u00a0 \n\nPope and his friend Swift had for years written scornful and very successful critical reviews of those whom they considered poor writers; in 1727 they began a series of parodies of the same writers. The adversaries hurled insults at Swift and Pope in return, and in 1728 Pope lampooned them in one of his best-known works, \"The Dunciad,\" a satire celebrating dullness. He later enlarged the work to four volumes, the final one appearing in 1743.\u00a0 In 1734 he completed his Essay on Man. Pope's last works, Imitations of Horace (1733-1739), were attacks on political enemies of his friends.\u00a0 But towards the close of his life Pope had lost most of his literary enemies, as he had been deprived of most of his intimate associates and friends. Yet popular fame surrounded him. When curiosity drew him to the theatre to witness one of the first performances of Garrick, the knowledge of Pope's presence filled the confident actor with an anxiety approaching awe. But gradually the end was approaching.\u00a0 \n\nThe last months of Pope's life were passed chiefly in the society of Warburton, though he was still ocassionally able to visit his older friends, Lord Bolingbroke and Marchmont, at Battersea: while Martha Bount, towards whom his affection remained unabated, solaced him by her occasional presence in his own home.\u00a0 Pope died after an open and free acknowledgement of the faith from the profession of which he had never swerved, and in a calm tranquillity, on the 30th of May, 1744. He was buried, according to the directions of his will, in Twickenham church, near the monument which his filial piety had erected to his parents.\u00a0 He desired no inscription on his tomb; but the officious devotion of Warburton, 17 years later, placarded a blank monument with an epigram written by Pope himself. , The acknowledged master of the heroic couplet and one of the primary tastemakers of the Augustan age, British writer Alexander Pope was a central figure in the Neoclassical movement of the early 18th century. He is known for having perfected the rhymed couplet form of his idol, John Dryden, and turned it to satiric and philosophical purposes. His mock epic The Rape of the Lock (1714) derides elite society, while An Essay on Criticism (1711) and An Essay on Man (1733&ndash;34) articulate many of the central tenets of 18th-century aesthetic and moral philosophy. Pope was noted for his involvement in public feuds with the writers and publishers of low-end Grub Street, which led him to write The Dunciad (1728), a scathing account of England&rsquo;s cultural decline, and, at the end of his life, a series of related verse essays and Horatian satires that articulated and protested this decline.\r\n\r\nPope is also remembered as the first full-time professional English writer, having supported himself largely on subscription fees for his popular translations of Homer and his edition of the works of William Shakespeare. Although a major cultural figure of the 18th century, Pope fell out of favor in the Romantic era as the Neoclassical appetite for form was replaced by a vogue for sincerity and authenticity. Interest in his poetry was revived in the early 20th century. He is recognized as a great formal master, an eloquent expositor of the spirit of his age, and a representative of the culture and politics of the Enlightenment.\r\n\r\nPope was born on May 21, 1688 to a wealthy Catholic linen merchant, Alexander Pope, and his second wife, Edith Turner. In the same year, the Protestant William of Orange took the English throne. Because Catholics were forbidden to hold office, practice their religion, attend public schools, or live within 10 miles of London, Pope grew up in nearby Windsor Forest and was mostly self-taught, his education supplemented by study with private tutors or priests. At the age of 12, he contracted spinal tuberculosis, which left him with permanent physical disabilities. He never grew taller than four and a half feet, was hunchbacked, and required daily care throughout adulthood. His irascible nature and unpopularity in the press are often attributed to three factors: his membership in a religious minority, his physical infirmity, and his exclusion from formal education. However, Pope was bright, precocious, and determined and, by his teens, was writing accomplished verse. His rise to fame was swift. Publisher Jacob Tonson included Pope&rsquo;s Pastorals, a quartet of early poems in the Virgilian style, in his Poetical Miscellanies (1709), and Pope published his first major work, An Essay on Criticism, at the age of 23. He soon became friends with Whig writers Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, editors of the Spectator, who published his essays and poems, and the appearance of The Rape of the Lock made him famous in wider circles.\r\n\r\nAn Essay on Criticism&nbsp;is a virtuosic exposition of literary theory, poetic practice, and moral philosophy. Bringing together themes and ideas from the history of philosophy, the three parts of the poem illustrate a golden age of culture, describe the fall of that age, and propose a platform to restore it through literary ethics and personal virtues. The work showcases Pope&rsquo;s mastery of the heroic couplet, in which he was capable of making longer arguments in verse as well as of producing such memorable phrases as &ldquo;The Sound must seem an Eccho to the Sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Err is humane; to Forgive, Divine.&rdquo; The mock epic The Rape of the Lock made Pope known to a general audience. Based on an actual incident in 1711, when Robert Lord Petre (&ldquo;The Baron&rdquo;) publicly cut a lock of hair from the head of Arabella Fermor (&ldquo;Belinda&rdquo;), and said to have been written at the request of a friend to encourage a rapprochement between the families, the poem nimbly depicts the foibles of high society. At once light-hearted and serious, addressing both the flimsiness of social status and the repercussions of public behavior, the poem is an in-depth study of contemporary social mores and the reasons for their existence. The Rape of the Lock was followed by &ldquo;Eloisa to Abelard&rdquo; (1717), which lyrically explored the 12th-century story of the passionate love of Helo&iuml;se d&rsquo;Argenteuil and her teacher, the philosopher Peter Abelard.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1720s, Pope became associated with a group of Tory literati called the Scriblerus Club, which included John Gay, Jonathan Swift, John Arbuthnot, and Thomas Parnell. The club encouraged Pope to release a new translation of Homer&rsquo;s Iliad (circa 8th century BCE) via subscription, a publication method whereby members of the public gave money in advance of a text&rsquo;s appearance with the agreement that they would receive handsome, inscribed editions of the completed volumes. The Iliad was a tremendously popular publishing venture, and it made Pope self-supporting. He followed with subscription editions of the Odyssey (circa 8th to 7th centuries BCE) and of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works. After these successes, Pope could afford a lavish lifestyle and moved to a grand villa at Twickenham. The estate&rsquo;s grounds included miniature sculptured gardens and a famous grotto, an underground passageway decorated with mirrors that connected the property to the London Road. Here, Pope feted friends and acquaintances, cultivated his love for gardening, and wrote increasingly caustic essays and poems. Frequently maligned in the press, he responded publicly with The Dunciad (1728), an attack on the Shakespearean editor Lewis Theobald; The Dunciad, Variorum (1729), which appends a series of mock footnotes vilifying other London publishers and booksellers; and another edition of The Dunciad that articulates the writer&rsquo;s concern over the decline of English society. Using the term &ldquo;duncery&rdquo; to refer to all that was tasteless, dull, and degraded in culture and literature, Pope mocked certain contemporary literary figures while making a larger point about the decline of art and culture. In the 1730s, Pope published two works on the same theme: An Essay on Man and a series of &ldquo;imitated&rdquo; satires and epistles of Horace (1733-38). After the final edition of The Dunciad was released in 1742, Pope began to revise and assemble his poetry for a collected edition. Before he could complete the work, he died of dropsy (edema) and acute asthma on May 30, 1744.\r\n\r\nAn Essay on Man is didactic and wide-reaching and was meant to be part of a larger work of moral philosophy that Pope never finished. Its four sections, or &ldquo;epistles,&rdquo; present an aesthetic and philosophical argument for the existence of order in the world, contending that we know the world to be unified because God created it. Thus, it is only our inferior vision that perceives disunity, and it is each man&rsquo;s duty to strive for the good and the orderly.\r\n\r\nPope&rsquo;s literary merit was debated throughout his life, and successive generations have continually reassessed the value of his works. Pope&rsquo;s satires and poetry of manners did not fit the Romantic and Victorian visions of poetry as a product of sincerity and emotion. He came to be seen as a philosopher and rhetorician rather than a poet, a view that persisted through the 19th and early 20th centuries. The rise of modernism, however, revived interest in pre-Romantic poetry, and Pope&rsquo;s use of poetic form and irony made him of particular interest to the New Critics. In the latter half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries, Pope remained central to the study of what scholars deem the long 18th century, a period loosely defined as beginning with publication of John Milton&rsquo;s&nbsp;Paradise Lost (1667) and extending through the first generation of the Romantics in the 1820s.\r\n\r\nModern scholars have evaluated Pope as a major literary voice engaged with both high and low cultural scenes, a key figure in the sphere of letters, and an articulate witness to the rise of the commercial printing age and the development of modem English national identity. Howard D. Weinbrot (1980) read Pope&rsquo;s late satires in the context of 18th-century neoclassicism, arguing that he did not simply imitate Horace but worked with elements from Juvenal and Persius as well. Pope, Weinbrot asserted, had a far wider satiric range than modem readers assume: he was &ldquo;more eclectic, hostile, and both sublime and vulgar.&rdquo; John Sitter (2007) concentrated on the range of voices employed by Pope in his poetry, offering an alternative to prevailing views on rhyme and the couplet form. Sophie Gee (2014) argued that The Rape of the Lock is important because of its emphasis on character and identity, a focus that she identified as novelistic, while Donna Landry (1995) placed Pope in the context of the critical history of landscape poetry, maintaining that he was a central figure in the 18th-century invention of the concept of the &ldquo;countryside.&rdquo; The transformation of the physical country into the aesthetic object of the countryside, Landry explained, is enacted through Pope&rsquo;s ideology of stewardship and control, which imagines a landscape halfway between the country and the city that Landry called an early version of suburbia.\r\n\r\nOther recent criticism has interpreted Pope&rsquo;s work in the contexts of gender and authorial identity. Claudia N. Thomas (1994) analyzed female readings of and commentary on Pope&rsquo;s writings as a way of documenting the experience of women in the 18th century, while J. Paul Hunter (2008) showed that Pope&rsquo;s later career choices emphasized his honesty and integrity and the connection between those characteristics and masculinity. Catherine Ingrassia (2000) argued that Pope&rsquo;s literary attacks allowed him to respond to criticism and keep his name before the public. In their study of Pope&rsquo;s self-representation as an artist, Paul Baines and Pat Rogers (2008) characterized Pope&rsquo;s poisoning of Edmund Curll&mdash;he placed an emetic in the bookseller&rsquo;s drink&mdash;as the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;first Horatian imitation,&rdquo; situating the event within a history of literary revenge., Alexander Pope  (21 May 1688  O.S. [1]  \u2013 30 May 1744) was an English poet, translator, and satirist of the  Enlightenment  era who is considered one of the most prominent English poets of the early 18th century. An exponent of  Augustan literature , [2]   Pope is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry including  The Rape of the Lock ,  The Dunciad , and  An Essay on Criticism ,  and for his translations of  Homer .Pope is often quoted in  The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations , some of his verses having entered common parlance (e.g. \" damning with faint praise \" or \" to err is human; to forgive, divine \").Alexander Pope was born in London on 21 May 1688 during the year of the  Glorious Revolution . His father (Alexander Pope, 1646\u20131717) was a successful linen merchant in the  Strand ,  London . His mother, Edith (n\u00e9e Turner, 1643\u20131733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of  York . Both parents were  Catholics . [3]  His mother's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter  Samuel Cooper . Pope's education was affected by the recently enacted  Test Acts , a series of English penal laws that upheld the status of the  established   Church of England , banning Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and attended  Twyford School  circa 1698. [3]  He also attended two Roman Catholic schools in London. [3]  Such schools, though still illegal, were tolerated in some areas. [4]In 1700, his family moved to a small estate at  Popeswood , in  Binfield ,  Berkshire , close to the royal  Windsor Forest . [3]  This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing \" Papists \" from living within 10 miles (16 km) of London or Westminster. [5]  Pope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem  Windsor Forest . [6]  Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the  satirists   Horace  and  Juvenal , the  epic poets   Homer  and  Virgil , as well as English authors such as  Geoffrey Chaucer ,  William Shakespeare  and  John Dryden . [3]  He studied many languages, reading works by French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as  William Congreve ,  Samuel Garth  and  William Trumbull . [3] [4]At Binfield he made many important friends. One of them,  John Caryll  (the future dedicatee of  The Rape of the Lock ), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright  William Wycherley  and to  William Walsh , a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work,  The Pastorals . There, he met the Blount sisters,  Teresa  and  Martha (Patty) , in 1707. He remained close friends with Patty until his death, but his friendship with Teresa ended in 1722. [7]From the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including  Pott disease , a form of  tuberculosis  that affects the spine, which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes and abdominal pain. [3]  He grew to a height of only 4 feet 6 inches (1.37 metres). Pope was already removed from society as a Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including  Lady Mary Wortley Montagu . It has been alleged that his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover. [4] [8] [9] [10]  His friend  William Cheselden  said, according to  Joseph Spence , \"I could give a more particular account of Mr. Pope's health than perhaps any man.  Cibber 's slander (of carnosity) is false. He had been gay [happy], but left that way of life upon his acquaintance with Mrs. B.\" [11]In May 1709, Pope's  Pastorals  was published in the sixth part of bookseller  Jacob Tonson 's  Poetical Miscellanies . This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by  An Essay on Criticism , published in May 1711, which was equally well received.Around 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers  Jonathan Swift ,  Thomas Parnell  and  John Arbuthnot , who together formed the satirical  Scriblerus Club . Its aim was to satirise ignorance and pedantry through the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with  Whig  writers  Joseph Addison  and  Richard Steele . In March 1713,  Windsor Forest [6]  was published to great acclaim. [4]During Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play  Cato , as well as writing for  The Guardian  and  The Spectator . Around this time, he began the work of translating the  Iliad , which was a painstaking process \u2013 publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720. [4]In 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the  Hanoverians  and the  Jacobites , leading to the  Jacobite rising of 1715 . Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, \"where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known\". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the  Tories , and Pope's friend  Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke , fled to France. This was added to by the  Impeachment  of the former Tory Chief Minister  Lord Oxford .Pope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row,  Chiswick , between 1716 and 1719; the red-brick building is now the  Mawson Arms , commemorating him with a  blue plaque . [12]The money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to  a villa at Twickenham , where he created his now-famous  grotto  and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked, \"Were it to have nymphs as well \u2013 it would be complete in everything.\" Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives beneath Radnor House Independent Co-educational School. [8] [13]  The grotto has been restored and will open to the public for 30 weekends a year from 2023 under the auspices of Pope's Grotto Preservation Trust. [14]An Essay on Criticism  was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.At the time the poem was published, its  heroic couplet  style was quite a new poetic form and Pope's work an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. It was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past. [15]The \"essay\" begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry, by which a critic passes judgement. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while analysing poetry, pointing out the important function critics perform in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to simply attacking them. [16]  The final section of  An Essay on Criticism  discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in an ideal critic, whom Pope claims is also the ideal man.Pope's most famous poem is  The Rape of the Lock , first published in 1712, with a revised version in 1714. A  mock-epic , it satirises a high-society quarrel between  Arabella Fermor  (the \"Belinda\" of the poem) and  Lord Petre , who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine, almost voyeuristic interest in the \"beau-monde\" (fashionable world) of 18th-century society. [17]  The revised, extended version of the poem focuses more clearly on its true subject: the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers. In the poem, purchased artefacts displace human agency and \"trivial things\" come to dominate. [18]Though  The Dunciad  first appeared anonymously in  Dublin , its authorship was not in doubt. Pope pilloried a host of other \"hacks\", \"scribblers\" and \"dunces\" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication \"in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life\". Though a masterpiece due to having become \"one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry\", writes Mack, \"it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.\" [19]According to his half-sister  Magdalen Rackett , some of Pope's targets were so enraged by  The Dunciad  that they threatened him physically. \"My brother does not seem to know what fear is,\" she told  Joseph Spence , explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his  Great Dane  Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket. [20]  This first  Dunciad , along with  John Gay 's  The Beggar's Opera  and Jonathan Swift's  Gulliver's Travels , joined in a concerted propaganda assault against  Robert Walpole 's Whig ministry and the financial revolution it stabilised. Although Pope was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, he never missed a chance to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From  The Rape of the Lock  onwards, these satirical themes appear constantly in his work.In 1731, Pope published his \"Epistle to  Burlington \", on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems later grouped as the  Moral Essays  (1731\u20131735). [21]  The epistle ridicules the bad taste of the aristocrat \"Timon\". [22]  For example, the following are verses 99 and 100 of the Epistle:At Timon's Villa let us pa\u017fs a day, Where all cry out, \"What \u017fums are thrown away!\" [22]Pope's foes claimed he was attacking the  Duke of Chandos  and his estate,  Cannons . Though the charge was untrue, it did much damage to Pope. [ citation needed ]There has been some speculation on a feud between Pope and  Thomas Hearne , due in part to the character of Wormius in  The Dunciad , who is seemingly based on Hearne. [23]An Essay on Man  is a philosophical poem in heroic couplets published between 1732 and 1734. Pope meant it as the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece that he sought to make into a larger work, but he did not live to complete it. [24]  It\nattempts to \"vindicate the ways of God to Man\", a variation on Milton's attempt in  Paradise Lost  to \"justify the ways of God to Man\" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric worldview. The poem is not solely Christian, however. It assumes that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation. [24]Consisting of four epistles addressed to  Lord Bolingbroke , it presents an idea of Pope's view of the Universe: no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe may be, it functions in a rational fashion according to natural laws, so that the Universe as a whole is a perfect work of God, though to humans it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope ascribes this to our limited mindset and intellectual capacity. He argues that humans must accept their position in the \"Great Chain of Being\", at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. Accomplish this and we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives. [24]The poem is an affirmative statement of faith: life seems chaotic and confusing to man in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is truly divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around as an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope, which then leads to faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it in terms of riches, power and fame. Pope proclaims that man's duty is to strive to be good, regardless of other situations. [25] [ failed verification ]The  Imitations of Horace  that followed (1733\u20131738) were written in the popular Augustan form of an \"imitation\" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of  Horace  to satirise life under  George II , especially what he saw as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste. Pope added as an introduction to  Imitations  a wholly original poem that reviews his own literary career and includes famous portraits of Lord  Hervey  (\" Sporus \"),  Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull  (\"Balbus\") and Addison (\"Atticus\").In 1738 came the  Universal Prayer . [26]Among the younger poets whose work Pope admired was  Joseph Thurston . [27]  After 1738, Pope himself wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called  Brutus , but only the opening lines survive. His major work in those years was to revise and expand his masterpiece,  The Dunciad . Book Four appeared in 1742 and a full revision of the whole poem the following year. Here Pope replaced the \"hero\" Lewis Theobald with the  Poet Laureate ,  Colley Cibber  as \"king of dunces\". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: \"Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.\" [28] [29]  He died at his villa surrounded by friends on 30 May 1744, about eleven o'clock at night. On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the  Last Rites  of the Catholic Church. He was buried in the nave of  St Mary's Church, Twickenham .Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced plans to publish a translation of the  Iliad . The work would be  available by subscription , with one volume appearing every year over six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him 200  guineas  (\u00a3210) a volume, a vast sum at the time.His  Iliad  translation appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by  Samuel Johnson  as \"a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal\".  Conversely, the classical scholar  Richard Bentley  wrote: \"It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.\" [30]Encouraged by the success of the  Iliad , Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's  Odyssey  in 1725\u20131726. [31]  For this Pope collaborated with  William Broome  and  Elijah Fenton : Broome translated eight books (2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 23), Fenton four (1, 4, 19, 20) and Pope the remaining 12. Broome provided the annotations. [32]  Pope tried to conceal the extent of the collaboration, but the secret leaked out. [33]  It did some damage to Pope's reputation for a time, but not to his profits. [34]   Leslie Stephen  considered Pope's portion of the  Odyssey  inferior to his version of the  Iliad , given that Pope had put more effort into the earlier work \u2013 to which, in any case, his style was better suited. [35]In this period, Pope was employed by the publisher  Jacob Tonson  to produce an opulent new edition of Shakespeare. [36]  When it appeared in 1725, it silently regularised Shakespeare's metre and rewrote his verse in several places. Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespeare's material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others. [36]  In 1726, the lawyer, poet and pantomime-deviser  Lewis Theobald  published a scathing pamphlet called  Shakespeare Restored , which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested several revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, wherefore Theobald became the main target of Pope's  Dunciad . [37]The second edition of Pope's  Shakespeare  appeared in 1728. [36]  Apart from some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.Pope's poetic career testifies to an indomitable spirit despite disadvantages of health and circumstance. The poet and his family were  Catholics  and so fell subject to the prohibitive  Test Acts , which hampered their co-religionists after the abdication of  James II . One of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, another from attending public school or university. So except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a book lover, reading in French, Italian, Latin and Greek and discovering Homer at the age of six. In 1700, when only twelve years of age, he wrote his poem  Ode on Solitude . [38] [39]  As a child Pope survived once being trampled by a  cow , but when he was 12 he began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine ( Pott disease ), which restricted his growth, so that he was only 4 feet 6 inches (1.37 metres) tall as an adult. He also suffered from crippling headaches.In the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of  Pastorals , his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the age of 23, he had written  An Essay on Criticism , released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of  Horace 's  Ars Poetica , it met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, notably  Joseph Addison  and  Richard Steele , who had recently begun to collaborate on the influential  The Spectator . The critic  John Dennis , having found an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he saw as the impudence of a younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.A folio containing a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, along with two new ones about the passion of love:  Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady  and the famous proto-romantic poem  Eloisa to Abelard . Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in his popular  Eloisa to Abelard , and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued through his life.As a  satirist , Pope made his share of enemies as critics, politicians and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharp-witted satires. Some were so virulent that Pope even carried pistols while walking his dog. In 1738 and thenceforth, Pope composed relatively little. He began having ideas for a patriotic epic in  blank verse  titled  Brutus , but mainly revised and expanded his  Dunciad . Book Four appeared in 1742; and a complete revision of the whole in the year that followed. At this time Lewis Theobald was replaced with the  Poet Laureate   Colley Cibber  as \"king of dunces\", but his real target remained the  Whig  politician  Robert Walpole .By the mid-18th century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent about his work. Though  Lord Byron  identified Pope as one of his chief influences \u2013 believing his own scathing satire of contemporary English literature  English Bards and Scotch Reviewers  to be a continuance of Pope's tradition \u2013  William Wordsworth  found Pope's style too decadent to represent the human condition. [4]  George Gilfillan in an 1856 study called Pope's talent \"a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful\". [40]Pope's reputation revived in the 20th century. His work was full of references to the people and places of his time, which aided people's understanding of the past. The post-war period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, in the late 20th-century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems appeared in ten volumes, including an index volume. [4].",
        "response": " Alexander Pope, the \"Wicked Wasp of Twickenham,\" was a brilliant and biting satirist of early 18th-century English literature. Pope was born in London on May 21, 1688, to a wealthy Catholic linen merchant and his second wife. Due to anti-Catholic sentiment and laws that prevented Catholics from living within 10 miles of London, Pope grew up in the countryside near Windsor Forest and was mostly self-taught. He was a child prodigy, reading classical writers in their original languages and composing his first poem, \"Ode on Solitude,\" at age 12.\n\nPope's literary career began in 1704 when he was introduced to a circle of fashionable London wits and writers, who welcomed him as a prodigy. He first attracted public attention in 1709 with his \"Pastorals,\" a quartet of poems in the style of Virgil. In 1711, his \"Essay on Criticism,\" a brilliant exposition of the canons of taste, was published, and his most famous poem, \"The Rape of the Lock,\" a mock-heroic work based on a true story, established his reputation securely. Pope was a master of the heroic couplet, and his poetry is known for its polished verse, wit, and satire.\n\nIn 1713, Pope published \"Windsor Forest,\" which endeared him to the Tories. The following year, his work \"The Wife of Bath\" appeared, which, like his \"The Temple of Fame\" (1715), was inspired by the works of the 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Pope's translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" was published in six volumes from 1715 to 1720, and a translation of the \"Odyssey\" followed in 1725-1726. He also published an edition of Shakespeare's plays in 1725.\n\nPope was a friend of the writer Jonathan Swift, and the two often wrote scornful reviews of writers they considered poor. In 1727, they began a series of parodies, and Pope's adversaries responded with insults. In 1728, Pope lampooned them in one of his most famous works, \"The Dunciad,\" a satire celebrating dullness. He later enlarged the work to four volumes, the final one appearing in 1743.\n\nIn 1734, Pope completed his \"Essay on Man,\" a philosophical poem in four epistles that presents an argument for the existence of order in the world and man's duty to strive for the good and the orderly. Pope's last works, \"Imitations of Horace\" (1733-1739), were attacks on the political enemies of his friends.\n\nPope struggled with health issues throughout his life, including spinal tuberculosis, which left him with permanent physical disabilities. He never grew taller than four and a half feet and was hunchbacked. He died on May 30, 1744, and was buried in Twickenham Church, near the monument he had erected for his parents.\n\nPope's literary merit has been debated, and his work has been reassessed by successive generations. He fell out of favor with the Romantics, who valued sincerity and emotion in poetry, but his reputation was revived in the 20th century. Today, he is recognized as a master of poetic form, an eloquent expositor of the spirit of his age, and a representative of the culture and politics of the Enlightenment.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Born to Alfred and Amelia Adams Noyes on September 16, 1880, Alfred Noyes grew up in Wolverhampton, England. His father, a grocer and a teacher, taught Noyes Latin and Greek. Noyes attended Exeter College, Oxford, but left before he earned a degree. At the age of twenty-one he published his first collection of poems, The Loom Years (1902), which received praise from respected poets such as William Butler Yeats and George Meredith.Between 1903 and 1908, Noyes published five volumes of poetry including The Forest of Wild Thyme (1905) and The Flower of Old Japan and Other Poems (1907). In his early work, Noyes claimed he was seeking to \"follow the careless and happy feet of children back into the kingdom of those dreams which...are the sole reality worth living and dying for; those beautiful dreams, or those fantastic jests.\" His books were widely reviewed and were published both in Britain and the United States. Among his best-known poems from this time are \"The Highwayman\" and \"Drake.\" \"Drake,\" which appeared serially in Blackwood's Magazine, was a two-hundred page epic about life at sea. Both in style and subject, the poem shows a clear influence of Romantic poets such as Tennyson and Wordsworth.In 1907, Noyes married Garnett Daniels. They had three children. His increasing popularity allowed the family to live off royalty checks. In 1914, Noyes accepted a teaching position at Princeton University, where he taught English Literature until 1923. He was a noted critic of modernist writers, particularly James Joyce. Likewise, his work at this time was criticized by some for its refusal to embrace the modernist movement.In 1922 he began an epic called The Torch Bearers, which was published in three volumes (Watchers of the Sky, 1922; The Book of Earth, 1925; and The Last Voyage, 1930). The book arose out of his visit to a telescope located at Mount Wilson, California and attempted to reconcile his views of science with religion. His wife died in 1926 and Noyes turned increasingly to Catholicism and religious themes in his later books, particularly The Unknown God (1934) and If Judgment Comes (1941). During the World War II, Noyes lived in Canada and America and was a strong advocate of the Allied effort. In 1949, he returned to Britain. As a result of increasing blindness, Noyes dictated all of his subsequent work. His autobiography, Two Worlds for Memory, was published in 1953. Alfred Noyes died on June 25, 1958, and was buried on Isle of Wight.William Wordsworth, who rallied for \"common speech\" within poems and argued against the poetic biases of the period, wrote some of the most influential poetry in Western literature, including his most famous work,\u00a0The Prelude, which is often considered to be the crowning achievement of English romanticism.William Butler Yeats, widely considered one of the greatest poets of the English language, received the 1923 Nobel Prize for Literature.\u00a0His work was greatly influenced by the heritage and politics of Ireland.Born in 1809, Edgar Allan Poe had a profound impact on American and international literature as an editor, poet, and critic.William Blake was born in London on November 28, 1757, to James, a hosier, and Catherine Blake. Two of his six siblings died in infancy. From early childhood, Blake spoke of having visions\u2014at four he saw God \"put his head to the window\"; around age nine, while walking through the countryside, he saw a tree filled with angels., Alfred Noyes was the son of Alfred and Amelia Adams Noyes.  He was born on the 16th of September in the year 1880 in the town of Wolverhamton, England. His father was a teacher and taught Latin and Greek and  in Aberystwyth, Wales. In 1898, Alfred attended Exeter College in Oxford. Though he failed to earn a degree, the young poet published his first collection of poetry, The Loom of Years, in 1902.Between 1903 and 1908, Noyes published five volumes of poetry including The Forest of Wild Thyme (1905) and The Flower of Old Japan and Other Poems (1907). His books were widely reviewed and were published both in Britain and the United States. Among his best-known poems from this time are The Highwayman and Drake.

In 1929, the family moved to Lisle Combe, St Lawrence, Isle of Wight where Noyes continued to write essays and poems, culminating in the collection, Orchard's Bay (1939). Alfred Noyes died on June 25, 1958, and was buried on the Isle of Wight.\n\n\n\nBibliography source: poets.org and historique.net, Extraordinarily prolific and decidedly popular among the reading public, Alfred Noyes enjoyed a full-fledged career as a writer and as an intellectual when few people of the era could depend solely on the writing craft to forge a comfortable living. Especially fond of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, William Wordsworth, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare, and adopting much of their style and content, Noyes most often exhibited a style infused with Romanticism and ballad-like simplicity, and his subject matter was usually optimistic and inspired by the natural beauties of the world. Noyes revered the polite formality of traditional English verse and despised the haphazardness and comparative literary disrespect of the modernist movement of the 20th century&mdash;especially the work of James Joyce&mdash;but some critics chastised his resistance to change and literary evolution.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that critics regarded Noyes as more of a businessman capable of selling his artistic wares than a serious, talented poet, there is no disputing Noyes&rsquo;s devotion to the written word. Born in 1880, Noyes was the son of a man who had sacrificed a higher education so that his younger brother could attend university. Noyes&rsquo;s father never abandoned his love of learning, and young Noyes was the beneficiary of his father&rsquo;s unrequited intellectual pursuits and ideals. His father taught Noyes Latin and Greek, and his academic nurturing secured him a place at Oxford University in 1898, though he left before earning his degree. Nonetheless, his first collection of poetry, The Loom of Years (1902), was published when he was only 21 years old, and received compliments from esteemed poets such as George Meredith and William Butler Yeats. Noyes married Garnett Daniels in 1907, and the couple lived off his royalty checks. That same year they visited the United States for the first time, and were entertained by such impressive company as&nbsp;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&rsquo;s daughters and Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s&nbsp;sons. Noyes enjoyed notable relationships throughout his life, apparently drinking tea with Theodore Roosevelt in 1919 just hours before his death and meeting privately with premier Benito Mussolini in 1939, just before the start of World War II.\r\n\r\nBy the age of 30, Noyes had firmly established himself as the most commercially popular poet of his time. According to Margaret B. McDowell in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, he had &ldquo;produced his first biography, William Morris (1908), and had collected his poems in eight full-length books. ... They were widely reviewed and several were published in both Britain and the United States. ... Thousands of readers bought Noyes&rsquo;s books of poems, cherished them, and even memorized parts of them.&rdquo; McDowell cited a comment from a review in a 1907 issue of the Atlantic Monthly that summed up Noyes&rsquo;s appeal: &ldquo;There is a proficiency in the workmanship that, coupled with Mr. Noyes&rsquo; humorous tenderness in approaching his theme, all but disarms criticism.&rdquo; However, as the Modernist movement commenced, critics would get harsher and harsher in their reviews of Noyes&rsquo;s work.\r\n\r\nThree different works consistently vie for the claim of being Noyes&rsquo;s best-known or most-celebrated endeavor. The first is Drake: An English Epic (1906&ndash;08), which achieved most of its exposure because of its serialization in Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine. Drake was an ambitious work&mdash;a 12-book, 200-page epic in blank verse&mdash;that poeticized life at sea, a common theme among English prose and poetry and frequently a favorite of Noyes&rsquo;s.\r\n\r\nAnother one of Noyes&rsquo;s frequently referenced work is &ldquo;The Highwayman,&rdquo; an atypically somber, violent poem described by Diane Roback and Richard Donahue in Publishers Weekly as being &ldquo;about a beautiful woman who dies (with her breast &lsquo;shattered ... drenched with her own red blood&rsquo;) to save her lover, who is, in turn, shot down &lsquo;like a dog on the highway.&rsquo;&rdquo; McDowell quoted Noyes as professing to have written &ldquo;The Highwayman&rdquo; in two days when he was 24, &ldquo;the age when I was genuinely excited by that kind of romantic story.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe third most-frequently cited work is a three-volume work called The Torch-Bearers (1922, 1925, and 1930), which was inspired after a visit in 1917 to a new telescope being installed at Mount Wilson, California. This trilogy was Noyes&rsquo;s attempt to reconcile science and religion, as it pays homage to progress in astronomy, biology, and other scientific advancements, as well as the theological and philosophical development of the human race. McDowell described the third volume, The Last Voyage, as reflecting &ldquo;the intensity of Noyes&rsquo;s theological search for one&rsquo;s destiny after life on earth and his increased preoccupation with religion following the death of Garnett,&rdquo; his first wife, who died in 1926. After her death, Noyes joined the Catholic Church, a transition that greatly influenced his later work.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lyon Phelps, writing in The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century, referred to Noyes as &ldquo;one of the most melodious of modern writers, with a witchery in words that at its best is irresistible. ... [H]e has the imagination of the inspired poet, giving him creative power to reveal anew the majesty of the untamed sea, and the mystery of the stars.&rdquo; His embodiment of lyrical simplicity and classic familiarity masking as chaste intellectualism was the reason his work was appreciated and adored by the masses. Phelps said, &ldquo;Alfred Noyes understands the heart of a child,&rdquo; and likened some of his prettier works to &ldquo;a kind of singing Alice-in-Wonderland.&rdquo; Because some of his work&mdash;particularly &ldquo;Flower of Old Japan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forest of Wild Thyme&rdquo;&mdash;sought to regard the world through the eyes of a child, Noyes felt he had to qualify his efforts. According to Phelps&rsquo;s essay, Noyes asked that his youthful poems &ldquo;not be taken merely as fairy-tales, but as an attempt to follow the careless and happy feet of children back into the kingdom of those dreams which ... are the sole reality worth living and dying for; those beautiful dreams, or those fantastic jests ... for which mankind has endured so many triumphant martyrdoms that even amidst the rush and roar of modern materialism they cannot be quite forgotten.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nNoyes&rsquo;s autobiography, Two Worlds for Memory, was published in 1953. He died on the Isle of Wight on June 25, 1958., Alfred Noyes   CBE  (16 September 1880 \u2013 25 June 1958) [3]  was an English poet, short-story writer and playwright.Noyes was born in  Wolverhampton ,  England the son of Alfred and Amelia Adams Noyes. When he was four, the family moved to  Aberystwyth , Wales, where his father taught Latin and Greek. [4]  The Welsh coast and mountains were an inspiration to Noyes.In 1898, he left Aberystwyth for  Exeter College, Oxford , where he distinguished himself at rowing, but failed to get his degree because he was meeting his publisher to arrange publication of his first volume of poems,  The Loom of Years  (1902) on a crucial day of his  finals  in 1903. [5] [2]Noyes published five more volumes of poetry from 1903 to 1913, among them  The Flower of Old Japan  (1903) and  Poems  (1904).  Poems  included \"The Barrel-Organ\". [6]   \"The Highwayman\"  was first published in the August 1906 issue of  Blackwood's Magazine , and included the following year in  Forty Singing Seamen and Other Poems . In a nationwide poll conducted by the  BBC  in 1995 to find Britain's favourite poem, \"The Highwayman\" was voted the nation's 15th favourite poem. [4]Another major work in this phase of his career was  Drake , a 200-page epic in  blank verse  about the Elizabethan naval commander Sir  Francis Drake , which was published in two volumes (1906 and 1908). The poem shows the clear influence of Romantic poets such as Tennyson and Wordsworth, both in style and subject.Noyes' only full-length play,  Sherwood , was published in 1911; it was reissued in 1926, with alterations, as  Robin Hood . One of his most popular poems, \"A Song of Sherwood\", [7]  also dates from 1911. Eventually, one of the more popular ballads dating from this period, \"Bacchus and the Pirates\", was set to music for two voices and piano by Michael Brough, and first performed at the  Swaledale Festival  in 2012.In 1907, Noyes married Garnett Daniels, youngest daughter of US Army Colonel Byron G. Daniels, a  Civil War  veteran who was for some years U.S. Consul at  Hull . [8]  Noyes first visited America in February 1913, partly to lecture on  world peace  and  disarmament  and partly to satisfy his wife's desire that he should gather fresh experiences in her homeland. His first lecture tour lasted six weeks, extending as far west as Chicago. It proved so successful that he decided to make a second trip to the US in October and to stay six months. In this trip, he visited the principal American universities, including  Princeton , where the impression he made on the faculty and undergraduates was so favourable that in February 1914 he was asked to join the staff as a visiting professor, lecturing on modern English literature from February to June. He accepted, [9]  and for the next nine years he and his wife divided their year between England and the US. At Princeton, Noyes' students included  F. Scott Fitzgerald ,  Edmund Wilson  and  John Peale Bishop . [10]  He resigned his professorship in 1923, but continued to travel and lecture throughout the United States for the rest of his life. His wife died in 1926 at  Saint-Jean-de-Luz , France, where she and Noyes were staying with friends. [11]Noyes is often portrayed by hostile critics as a  militarist  and  jingoist . [12]  Actually, he was a  pacifist  who hated war and lectured against it, but felt that, when threatened by an aggressive and unreasoning enemy, a nation could not but fight. On this principle, he opposed the  Boer War , [12]  but supported the Allies in both the  World Wars . In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called  The Wine Press . One American reviewer wrote that Noyes was \"inspired by a fervent hatred of war and all that war means\", and had used \"all the resources of his varied art\" to depict its \"ultimate horror\". [13]  The poet and critic Helen Bullis found Noyes' \"anti-militarist\" poem \"remarkable\", \"passionate and inspiring\", but, in its \"unsparing realism\", lacking in \"the large vision, which sees the ultimate truth rather than the immediate details\". In her view, Noyes failed to address the \"vital questions\" raised, for example, by  William James ' observation that for modern man, \"War is the  strong  life; it is life  in extremis \", or by  Shakespeare 's invocation in  The Two Noble Kinsmen  of war as the \"great corrector\" that heals and cures \"sick\" times. [14]  Bullis, a  Freudian [15]  (unlike Noyes, for whom  psychoanalysis  was a  pseudo-science ), [16]  thought war had deeper roots than Noyes acknowledged. She saw looming \"the great figures of the  Fates [17]  back of the conflict, while Mr Noyes sees only the 'five men in black tail-coats' whose cold statecraft is responsible for it\". [14]  In 1915,  Upton Sinclair  included some striking passages from  The Wine Press  in his anthology of the literature of social protest,  The Cry for Justice . [18]During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front. [19]  Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the  Foreign Office , where he worked with  John Buchan  on propaganda. [2]  He also did his patriotic chore as a literary figure, writing morale-boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England's military past and asserting the morality of her cause. [12]  These works are now forgotten, apart from two ghost stories, \"The  Lusitania  Waits\" and \"The Log of the  Evening Star \", which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny. \"The  Lusitania  Waits\" is a ghost revenge story based on the sinking of the  Lusitania  by a German submarine in 1915 \u2013 although the tale hinges on an erroneous claim that the submarine crew had been awarded the  Goetz medal  for sinking the ship.During World War II, Noyes wrote the same kind of patriotic poems, but he also wrote a much longer and more considered work,  If Judgement Comes , in which  Hitler  stands accused before the tribunal of history. It was first published separately (1941) and then in the collection,  Shadows on the Down and Other Poems  (1945). The only fiction Noyes published in World War II was  The Last Man  (1940), a science fiction novel whose message could hardly be more anti-war. In the first chapter, a global conflict wipes out almost the entire human race.Noyes' best-known anti-war poem, \"The Victory Ball\" (aka \"A Victory Dance\"), [20]  was first published in  The Saturday Evening Post  in 1920. He wrote it after attending a ball held in London soon after the  Armistice , where he found himself wondering what the ghosts of the soldiers who had died in the war would say if they could observe the thoughtless frivolity of the dancers. The message of the poem lies in the line, \"Under the dancing feet are the graves.\" A brief passage about a girl \"fresh from school\" who \"begs for a dose of the best cocaine\" was replaced by something innocuous in the  Post  version, but reinstated when the poem appeared in a collection of Noyes' verse. \"The Victory Ball\" was turned into a  symphonic poem  by  Ernest Schelling [21]  and into a ballet by Benjamin Zemach. [22]  In 1966, at the height of the  Vietnam War , Congressman  H. R. Gross , indignant at a  White House  dinner dance that went on until 3 a.m. while American soldiers were giving their lives, inserted Noyes' poem in the  Congressional Record  as bearing \"directly on the subject matter in hand\". [23]In 1918, Noyes' short story collection,  Walking Shadows: Sea Tales and Others , came out. It included both \"The  Lusitania  Waits\" and \"The Log of the  Evening Star \". In 1924 Noyes published another collection,  The Hidden Player , which included a novella,  Beyond the Desert: A Tale of Death Valley , already published separately in America in 1920.For the  Pageant of Empire  at the 1924  British Empire Exhibition , Noyes wrote a series of poems set to music by Sir  Edward Elgar  and known as  Pageant of Empire . Among these poems was  Shakespeare's Kingdom .In 1929, Noyes published the first of his three novels,  The Return of the Scare-Crow  (US title:  The Sun Cure [24] ). A light-hearted story combining adventure, satire and comedy, it is about an earnest young clergyman named Basil.  During a walk on the South Downs, Basil comes across a ruined cottage, where he decides to try sunbathing naked, as recommended by a friend.  His clothes vanish, and he has to battle his way back to them through a series of mental hazards \u2013 all the latest intellectual fads and follies \u2013 and ends up rather less na\u00efve than before.In 1927, the year after his first wife's death, Noyes married Mary Angela  n\u00e9e  Mayne (1889\u20131976), widow of Lieutenant Richard Shireburn Weld-Blundell, a member of the old  recusant Catholic   Weld-Blundell family , who had been killed in World War I. [25]  Later that year, Noyes himself converted to  Catholicism . He gives an account of his conversion in his autobiography,  Two Worlds for Memory  (1953), but sets forth the more intellectual steps by which he was led from agnosticism to the Catholic faith in  The Unknown God  (1934), [11]  a widely read work of Christian  apologetics [ citation needed ]  which has been described as \"the spiritual biography of a generation\". [26]  In 1929, Noyes and Mary Angela settled at  Lisle Combe , on the  Undercliff  near  Ventnor , Isle of Wight. They had three children: Hugh (1929\u20132000), [ citation needed ]  Veronica and Margaret. Noyes' younger daughter married  Michael Nolan  (later Lord Nolan) in 1953.Noyes' ambitious epic verse trilogy  The Torch-Bearers  \u2013 comprising  Watchers of the Sky  (1922),  The Book of Earth  (1925) and  The Last Voyage  (1930) \u2013 deals with the history of science. In the \"Prefatory Note\" to  Watchers of the Sky , Noyes expresses his purpose in writing the trilogy:This volume, while it is complete in itself, is also the first of a trilogy, the scope of which is suggested in the prologue. The story of scientific discovery has its own epic unity \u2013 a unity of purpose and endeavour \u2013 the single torch passing from hand to hand through the centuries; and the great moments of science when, after long labour, the pioneers saw their accumulated facts falling into a significant order \u2013 sometimes in the form of a law that revolutionised the whole world of thought \u2013 have an intense human interest, and belong essentially to the creative imagination of poetry. It is with these moments that my poem is chiefly concerned, not with any impossible attempt to cover the whole field or to make a new poetic system, after the  Lucretian  model, out of modern science.Noyes adds that the theme of the trilogy had long been in his mind, but the first volume, dealing with  Watchers of the Sky , began to take definite shape only on the night of 1/2 November 1917, when the 100-inch  reflecting telescope  at  Mount Wilson Observatory  was first tested by starlight.  George Ellery Hale , the man who conceived and founded the observatory, had invited Noyes, who was then in California, to be his guest on this momentous occasion, and the prologue, subtitled \"The Observatory\", gives Noyes' detailed description of that \"unforgettable...night\". In his review of  Watchers of the Sky , the scholar and  historian of science   Frederick E. Brasch  writes that Noyes' \"journey up to the mountain's top, the observatory, the monastery, telescopes and mirrors, clockwork, switchboard, the lighted city below, planets and stars, atoms and electrons all are woven into...beautiful narrative poetry. It seems almost incredible that technical terms and concepts could lend themselves for that purpose.\" [27]After the prologue come seven long poems, each of which depicts salient episodes in the career of a major scientist, so as to bring out both the \"intensely human drama\" (\"Prefatory Note\") of his life and his contribution to astronomy. Noyes' seven scientists are  Nicolaus Copernicus ,  Tycho Brahe ,  Johannes Kepler ,  Galileo Galilei , [28]   Isaac Newton , and  William  and  John Herschel  \u2013 though due mention is also made of the contribution of  Caroline Herschel , sister to William and aunt to John. In the epilogue, Noyes meditates once more upon the mountain in the morning, before bringing his narrative to a close in the form of a prayer.In his review, Frederick E. Brasch writes that Noyes' \"knowledge of the science of astronomy and its history...seems remarkable in one who is so entirely unrelated to the work of an observatory\".  Watchers of the Sky , he adds, will no doubt appeal to the layman \"for its beauty and the music of its narrative verse, broken and interspersed with epic poetry. But it remains for the astronomer and other scholars in science to enjoy it to the fullness which is adequate to Noyes' ability as a poet.\" [27]The Book of Earth  is the second volume in the trilogy. In eight sections framed by a meditative prologue and epilogue, it follows the discoveries of scientists in their struggles to solve the mysteries of the earth, of life forms, and of human origins. Starting in ancient Greece with  Pythagoras  and  Aristotle , it then moves to the Middle East for  Al-Farabi  and  Avicenna . The scene then shifts successively to Italy for  Leonardo da Vinci , France for  Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard , Sweden for  Carl Linnaeus , France again for  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon ,  Jean Baptiste Lamarck ,  Antoine Lavoisier , and  Georges Cuvier , and then Germany for  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , before ending in England with  Charles Darwin . Reviewing  The Book of Earth  for  Nature , F. S. Marvin wrote, \"It deals with a much more difficult subject from the point of view of poetic presentation, namely biology, or rather geology as a preface to zoology and evolution as crowning geology.\" Nevertheless, it does not \"belie the...expectations\" raised by its predecessor. [29]Before Noyes had begun proper work on the final volume in the trilogy,  The Last Voyage , two events occurred which were to influence it greatly: his first wife's death and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Death is a major theme in  The Last Voyage , as its very title suggests. The tone, more sombre than that of its predecessors, is also more religious \u2013 though religion was hardly absent from the earlier volumes \u2013 and, as might be expected, more specifically Catholic.The Last Voyage  begins at night in mid-Atlantic, where an ocean liner, \"a great ship like a lighted city\", is battling through a raging storm. A little girl is mortally ill. The ship's surgeon prepares to operate, but with little hope of success, for the case is complicated and he is no specialist. Luckily, the captain knows from the  wireless  news that a top specialist from  Johns Hopkins Hospital  is on another liner 400 miles away \u2013 within wireless range. The ship's surgeon will be able to consult him, and stay in touch with him throughout the operation. Suddenly, the little girl's chances of survival are much improved. In a manner of speaking, all the scientific discoveries and inventions of the past are being brought to bear in the attempt to save her life. When the poet asks a casually-met fellow-passenger, \"You think they'll save her?\" the stranger replies, \" They  may save her\", and then adds enigmatically, \"But who are  They ?\"Reflecting, the poet realises that  They  are all the seekers and discoverers of scientific truths through the ages \u2013 people like  William Harvey ,  Louis Pasteur  and  Joseph Lister  in the field of medicine or  Michael Faraday ,  James Clerk Maxwell  and  Heinrich Hertz  in the development of the wireless. Nevertheless, despite the united efforts of all, the little girl dies, and in the darkness of that loss the poet finds that only in  Faith  can a flicker of light be found. Science cannot defeat death in the long run, and sometimes, as in the little girl's case, not even in the short run, but if \"Love, not Death\" is the ultimate reality, death will not have the final word. Of course, the \"last voyage\" of the title is not just that of the little girl or of Noyes' wife \u2013 though there are lyrics mourning her in Section XIII and another in the Dedication at the end \u2013 but of everyman and everywoman.F. S. Marvin, who reviewed all three volumes of  The Torch-Bearers  for  Nature , wrote that \"the third volume is certainly the best from the artistic point of view. It contains one well-conceived and highly interesting incident, around which the author's pictures of the past and incidental lyrics are effectively grouped, and it leads up to a full and eloquent exposition of the religious synthesis with which the history of science inspires him.\" [30]In 1940 Noyes published a science fiction novel,  The Last Man  (US title:  No Other Man ), [31]  in which the human race is almost wiped out by a powerful  death ray  capable of killing everyone, friend or foe, unless they are in a steel chamber deep under the surface of the sea. The inventor's chief assistant unscrupulously sells the plans to the leading nations of the world, who declare they will use the ray only as a \"last resort\". When events spiral out of control, however, they all activate it, killing everyone living on the earth. [32]When the death ray strikes, a 29-year-old Englishman named Mark Adams is trapped in a sunken submarine. Managing to escape, he finds himself the only survivor in Britain. He travels to Paris in the hope of finding another survivor. There he discovers a clue which gives him hope. His search leads him to Italy, where he finally finds the other survivor, an American girl named Evelyn Hamilton. At the time when the death ray struck, she was in a  diving bell  deep below the surface of the Mediterranean, where, under the guidance of Mardok, an immensely wealthy magnate and scientific genius, she was engaged in photographing the floor of the sea. Her companion turns out to be the villain of the story. Knowing the power of the ray, for whose development he had been largely responsible, he had made sure that, at the time of its activation, he was safely out of its reach, along with an attractive young woman with whom he could later begin the repopulation of the planet. Evelyn, however, finds him repulsive, and the arrival of the upstanding, handsome young Englishman further upsets Mardok's plan. In the ensuing competition between the two men for the girl, Mark Adams' surname is a clear hint at which of the two is better fitted to be  Adam  to Evelyn's  Eve . The two young people fall in love, but Mardok kidnaps Evelyn. After her escape and Mardok's death, [32]  the novel concludes with the young couple's discovery of some other survivors at  Assisi . [33]For Charles Holland, reviewing the novel in the 1940s, Noyes' combination of \"such elements of human interest as apologetics, art, travel and a captivating love story\" mean that the reader of  The Last Man  is assured of both \"an intellectual treat and real entertainment\". [32]  Eric Atlas, writing in an early  science fiction fanzine , found the novel, despite some flaws, \"well worth the reading \u2013 perhaps twice\". The philosophico-religious theme, he wrote, \"detracts in no way from the forceful characterizations...of Mark and Evelyn\". Besides, most of the novel is set \"in Italy, where Noyes' descriptive powers as a poet come to the fore\". [34]   The Last Man  seems to be the novel which introduced the idea of a  doomsday weapon . [35]  It is thought to have been among the influences on  George Orwell 's  Nineteen Eighty-Four . [36]In 1940, Noyes returned to North America, where he lectured and advocated the British war position. [2]  The following year, he gave the  Josiah Wood  lectures at  Mount Allison University , New Brunswick, Canada. Titled  The Edge of the Abyss , they were first published in Canada in 1942 and then, in a revised version, in the United States the same year [26]  and in Britain two years later. In  The Edge of the Abyss , Noyes ponders the future of the world, attacking totalitarianism, bureaucracy, the pervasive power of the state, and the collapse of moral standards.  George Orwell  reviewed the book for  The Observer  and, like  The Last Man , it is considered a probable influence on  Nineteen Eighty-Four . [36]In his review, Orwell wrote that  The Edge of the Abyss  \"raises a real problem\" \u2013 the \"decay in the belief in absolute good and evil\", with the result that the \"rules of behaviour on which any stable society has to rest are dissolving\" and \"even the prudential reasons for common decency are being forgotten\". Indeed, in Orwell's view, Noyes \"probably even underemphasises the harm done to ordinary common sense by the cult of 'realism', with its inherent tendency to assume that the dishonest course is always the profitable one\". On the other hand, Orwell finds Noyes' suggested remedy, a return to Christianity, \"doubtful, even from the point of view of practicality\". He agrees that the \"real problem of our time is to restore the sense of absolute right and wrong\", which in the past had ultimately rested on \"faith\", but he thinks that Noyes \"is probably wrong in imagining that the Christian faith, as it existed in the past, can be restored even in Europe\". Orwell offers no suggestion, however, as to what, other than faith, could serve as a basis for morality. [37]Noyes remained in retirement in California for some years. [26]  In 1943, he published  The Secret of Pooduck Island , a children's story set off the coast of  Maine . It features a family of squirrels threatened by natural enemies (skunks, weasels) and humans, the ghost of a Native American man who suffered a terrible sorrow in the  colonial era , and a teenage boy who has ambitions to be an artist and who is able to help both the squirrels and the ghost. It is, however, far more profound and terrible than the lighthearted accounts of animal behaviour seem on the surface to indicate; a mysterious voice keeps whispering words of mystery to the artist Solo, and most of the characters turn out to be incarnations of the various follies and stupidities of mankind: the fierce lonely boy-artist (who is nearly locked up as insane by the petty spiteful villagers) and the pudgy but wise priest, as well as the solemn ghost of Squando, being the only exceptions against which the others are contrasted. The entire \"secret\" of Pooduck Island consists in the gleams of the supernatural that blaze through the canopy of the material world, like a glimpse of the ocean through an arch in the woods that Solo names the \"Eye\" of the island. The mysterious Voice, who is hinted to be Glooskap himself, appears indirectly as an invisible model for a portrait of the Squirrel family, who think they are seated on a stump: but the picture records him. [ clarification needed ]In 1949, Noyes returned to his home on the  Isle of Wight . [26]  As a result of increasing blindness, he dictated all his subsequent works. [2]  In 1952 he brought out another book for children,  Daddy Fell into the Pond and Other Poems . The title poem [38]  has remained a firm favourite with children ever since. In 2005, it was one of the few poems that featured in both of two major anthologies of poetry for children published that year, one edited by  Caroline Kennedy , the other by  Elise Paschen . [39]In 1955, Noyes published the satirical  fantasy  novel  The Devil Takes A Holiday , [40]  in which the  Devil , in the guise of Mr Lucius Balliol, an international financier, comes to  Santa Barbara, California , for a pleasant little holiday. He finds however, that his work is being so efficiently performed by humankind that he has become redundant. The unwonted soul-searching this leads him to is not only painful but also \u2013 owing to a  tragicomic  twist at the end \u2013 ultimately futile.Noyes' last book of poetry,  A Letter to Lucian and Other Poems , came out in 1956, two years before his death by polio.In 1957, Noyes published his last book,  The Accusing Ghost, or Justice for Casement  (US title:  The Accusing Ghost of Roger Casement ). In 1916, the renowned human rights campaigner  Roger Casement  was hanged for his involvement in the Irish Nationalist revolt in Dublin known as the  Easter Rising . To forestall calls for clemency, the British authorities showed public figures and known sympathizers selected pages from some of Casement's diaries \u2013 known as the  Black Diaries  \u2013 that exposed him as a promiscuous homosexual. In an era of institutionalised  homophobia , this underhand tactic worked and the protests and petitions for Casement's reprieve failed. [41]Among those who read these extracts was Noyes, who was then working in the News Department of the Foreign Office and who described the pages as a \"foul record\" of \"the lowest depths that human degradation has ever touched\". Later that year in  Philadelphia , when Noyes was about to give a lecture on the English poets, he was confronted by Casement's sister, Nina, who denounced him as a \"blackguardly scoundrel\" and cried, \"Your countrymen hanged my brother Roger Casement.\" [41]Worse was to come. After Casement's death, the British authorities held the diaries in conditions of extraordinary secrecy, arousing strong suspicions among Casement's supporters that they were forged. In 1936, there appeared a book by an American doctor, William J. Maloney, called  The Forged Casement Diaries . After reading it,  W. B. Yeats  wrote a protest poem, \"Roger Casement\", which was published with great prominence in  The Irish Press . [42]  In the fifth stanza of the poem, Yeats named Alfred Noyes and called on him to desert the side of the forger and perjurer. Noyes immediately responded with a letter to  The Irish Press  in which he explained why he had assumed the diaries were authentic, confessed he might have been misled, [41]  and called for the setting up of a committee to examine the original documents and settle the matter. In response to what he called Noyes' \"noble\" letter, Yeats amended his poem, removing Noyes' name. [42]Over twenty years later, Casement's diaries were still being held in the same conditions of secrecy. In 1957, therefore, Noyes published  The Accusing Ghost, or Justice for Casement , a stinging rebuke of British policy [42]  in which, making full amends for his previous harsh judgement, he argued that Casement had indeed been the victim of a  British Intelligence  plot. [41]In 2002, a  forensic  examination of the  Black Diaries  concluded that they were authentic. [41]Noyes' last poem,  Ballade of the Breaking Shell , was written in May 1958, one month before his death. [43]   He died at the age of 77, and is buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at  Totland ,  Isle of Wight . [2].",
        "response": "\nBiography:\n\nAlfred Noyes was born on September 16, 1880, in Wolverhampton, England, to Alfred and Amelia Adams Noyes. His father, a grocer and teacher, taught him Latin and Greek, instilling in him a love of language and literature from a young age. Noyes' formal education began at Exeter College, Oxford, but he left before obtaining a degree, choosing instead to pursue a career in writing.\n\nNoyes' first collection of poems, 'The Loom Years', was published in 1902 when he was just 21 years old. This early work established him as a rising talent, garnering praise from renowned poets such as William Butler Yeats and George Meredith. Noyes' poetry often reflected his interest in science and religion, as well as his love of nature and the English countryside. He had a particular affinity for the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, William Wordsworth, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare, and his own writing exhibited a style infused with Romanticism and ballad-like simplicity.\n\nIn 1907, Noyes married Garnett Daniels, and the couple lived off his earnings as a poet. They traveled to the United States, where they mingled with the literary and social elite, including the families of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Noyes also had notable encounters with historical figures, such as drinking tea with Theodore Roosevelt and meeting privately with Benito Mussolini.\n\nBy the age of 30, Noyes had firmly established himself as a commercially successful poet. He published several collections of poetry, including 'The Forest of Wild Thyme' and 'The Flower of Old Japan and Other Poems'. His work was widely reviewed and published in both Britain and the United States, with thousands of readers cherishing his poems and even memorizing them. One of his most famous poems from this period is 'The Highwayman', a somber and violent poem about a woman who sacrifices her life to save her lover.\n\nIn addition to poetry, Noyes also wrote an epic trilogy called 'The Torch Bearers', inspired by a visit to a telescope at Mount Wilson, California. This work attempted to reconcile science and religion, reflecting his own spiritual journey. After the death of his first wife, Noyes converted to Catholicism and married Mary Angela Mayne Weld-Blundell. His later work explored religious themes, particularly in 'The Unknown God' and 'If Judgment Comes'.\n\nNoyes was also a noted critic of modernist writers, especially James Joyce, whom he believed represented the haphazardness and literary disrespect of the modernist movement. This stance drew criticism from those who felt he was resistant to literary evolution. Despite this, Noyes' work was admired by many, including William Lyon Phelps, who described him as \"one of the most melodious of modern writers, with a witchery in words that at its best is irresistible.\"\n\nNoyes' autobiography, 'Two Worlds for Memory', was published in 1953, and he continued to write until his death on June 25, 1958, on the Isle of Wight, leaving behind a legacy of poetic works that continue to be cherished by readers.",

This is his story. \n\nAs a young man, Noyes' talent was quickly recognized with the publication of his first collection, 'The Loom Years', in 1902. Renowned poets such as William Butler Yeats praised his work, and Noyes soon found himself among the literary elite, rubbing shoulders with the families of iconic American writers.

In his own day he was said to be&mdash;with Queen Victoria and Prime Minister William Gladstone&mdash;one of the three most famous living persons, a reputation no other poet writing in English has ever had. As official poetic spokesman for the reign of Victoria, he felt called upon to celebrate a quickly changing industrial and mercantile world with which he felt little in common, for his deepest sympathies were called forth by an unaltered rural England; the conflict between what he thought of as his duty to society and his allegiance to the eternal beauty of nature seems peculiarly Victorian. Even his most severe critics have always recognized his lyric gift for sound and cadence, a gift probably unequaled in the history of English poetry.\r\n\r\nThe lurid history of Tennyson&rsquo;s family is interesting in itself, but some knowledge of it is also essential for understanding the recurrence in his poetry of themes of madness, murder, avarice, miserliness, social climbing, marriages arranged for profit instead of love, and estrangements between families and friends.\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson was born in the depths of Lincolnshire, the 4th son of the 12 children of the rector of Somersby, George Clayton Tennyson, a cultivated but embittered clergyman who took out his disappointment on his wife Elizabeth and his brood of children&mdash;on at least one occasion threatening to kill Alfred&rsquo;s elder brother Frederick. The rector had been pushed into the church by his own father, also named George, a rich and ambitious country solicitor intent on founding a great family dynasty that would rise above their modest origins into a place among the English aristocracy. Old Mr. Tennyson, aware that his eldest son, the rector, was unpromising material for the family struggle upward, made his second son, his favorite child, his chief heir. Tennyson&rsquo;s father, who had a strong streak of mental instability, reacted to his virtual disinheritance by taking to drink and drugs, making the home atmosphere so sour that the family spoke of the &ldquo;black blood&rdquo; of the Tennysons.\r\n\r\nPart of the family heritage was a strain of epilepsy, a disease then thought to be brought on by sexual excess and therefore shameful. One of Tennyson&rsquo;s brothers was confined to an insane asylum most of his life, another had recurrent bouts of addiction to drugs, a third had to be put into a mental home because of his alcoholism, another was intermittently confined and died relatively young. Of the rest of the 11 children who reached maturity, all had at least one severe mental breakdown. During the first half of his life Alfred thought that he had inherited epilepsy from his father and that it was responsible for the trances into which he occasionally fell until he was well over 40 years old.\r\n\r\nIt was in part to escape from the unhappy environment of Somersby rectory that Alfred began writing poetry long before he was sent to school, as did most of his talented brothers and sisters. All his life he used writing as a way of taking his mind from his troubles. One aspect of his method of composition was set, too, while he was still a boy: he would make up phrases or discrete lines as he walked, and store them in his memory until he had a proper setting for them. As this practice suggests, his primary consideration was more often rhythm and language than discursive meaning.\r\n\r\nWhen he was not quite 18 his first volume of poetry,&nbsp;Poems by Two Brothers&nbsp;(1827), was published. Alfred Tennyson wrote the major part of the volume, although it also contained poems by his two elder brothers, Frederick and Charles. It is a remarkable book for so young a poet, displaying great virtuosity of versification and the prodigality of imagery that was to mark his later works; but it is also derivative in its ideas, many of which came from his reading in his father&rsquo;s library. Few copies were sold, and there were only two brief reviews, but its publication confirmed Tennyson&rsquo;s determination to devote his life to poetry.\r\n\r\nMost of Tennyson&rsquo;s early education was under the direction of his father, although he spent nearly four unhappy years at a nearby grammar school. His departure in 1827 to join his elder brothers at Trinity College, Cambridge, was due more to a desire to escape from Somersby than to a desire to undertake serious academic work. At Trinity he was living for the first time among young men of his own age who knew little of the problems that had beset him for so long; he was delighted to make new friends; he was extraordinarily handsome, intelligent, humorous, and gifted at impersonation; and soon he was at the center of an admiring group of young men interested in poetry and conversation. It was probably the happiest period of his life.\r\n\r\nIn part it was the urging of his friends, in part the insistence of his father that led the normally indolent Tennyson to retailor an old poem on the subject of Armageddon and submit it in the competition for the chancellor&rsquo;s gold medal for poetry; the announced subject was Timbuctoo. Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Timbuctoo&rdquo; is a strange poem, as the process of its creation would suggest. He uses the legendary city for a consideration of the relative validity of imagination and objective reality; Timbuctoo takes its magic from the mind of man, but it can turn to dust at the touch of the mundane. It is far from a successful poem, but it shows how deeply engaged its author was with the Romantic conception of poetry. Whatever its shortcomings, it won the chancellor&rsquo;s prize in the summer of 1829.\r\n\r\nProbably more important than its success in the competition was the fact that the submission of the poem brought Tennyson into contact with the Trinity undergraduate usually regarded as the most brilliant man of his Cambridge generation, Arthur Henry Hallam. This was the beginning of four years of warm friendship between the two men, in some ways the most intense emotional experience of Tennyson&rsquo;s life.\r\n\r\nAlso in 1829 both Hallam and Tennyson became members of the secret society known as the Apostles, a group of roughly a dozen undergraduates who were usually regarded as the elite of the entire university. Tennyson&rsquo;s name has ever since been linked with the society, but the truth is that he dropped out of it after only a few meetings, although he retained his closeness with the other members and might even be said to have remained the poetic center of the group. The affection and acceptance he felt from his friends brought both a new warmth to Tennyson&rsquo;s personality and an increasing sensuousness to the poetry he was constantly writing when he was supposed to be devoting his time to his studies.\r\n\r\nHallam, too, wrote poetry, and the two friends planned on having their work published together; but at the last moment Hallam&rsquo;s father, perhaps worried by some lyrics Arthur had written to a young lady with whom he had been in love, forbade him to include his poems.&nbsp;Poems, Chiefly Lyrical&nbsp;appeared in June 1830. The standard of the poems in the volume is uneven, and it has the self-centered, introspective quality that one might expect of the work of a 20-year-old; but scattered among the other poems that would be forgotten if they had been written by someone else are several fine ones such as &ldquo;The Kraken,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ode to Memory,&rdquo; and&mdash;above all&mdash;&ldquo;Mariana,&rdquo; which is the first of Tennyson&rsquo;s works to demonstrate fully his brilliant use of objects and landscapes to convey a state of strong emotion. That poem alone would be enough to justify the entire volume. The reviews appeared slowly, but they were generally favorable.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between the young men was knotted even more tightly when Hallam fell in love with Tennyson&rsquo;s younger sister, Emily, on a visit to Somersby. Since they were both so young, there was no chance of their marrying for some time, and meanwhile Hallam had to finish his undergraduate years at Trinity. All the Tennyson brothers and sisters, as well as their mother, seem to have taken instantly to Hallam, but he and Emily prudently said nothing of their love to either of their fathers. Dr. Tennyson was absent on the Continent most of the time, sent there by his father and his brother in the hope that he might get over his drinking and manage Somersby parish sensibly. Arthur&rsquo;s father, the distinguished historian Henry Hallam, had plans for his son that did not include marriage to the daughter of an obscure and alcoholic country clergyman.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830 Tennyson and Hallam were involved in a harebrained scheme to take money and secret messages to revolutionaries plotting the overthrow of the Spanish king. Tennyson&rsquo;s political enthusiasm was considerably cooler than Hallam&rsquo;s, but he was glad to make his first trip abroad. They went through France to the Pyrenees, meeting the revolutionaries at the Spanish border. Even Hallam&rsquo;s idealistic fervor scarcely survived the disillusionment of realizing that the men they met were animated by motives as selfish as those of the royalist party against whom they were rebelling. Nonetheless, in the Pyrenees Tennyson marked out a new dimension of the metaphorical landscape that had already shown itself in &ldquo;Mariana,&rdquo; and for the rest of his life the mountains remained as a model for the classical scenery that so often formed the backdrop of his poetry. The Pyrenees generated such marvelous poems as &ldquo;Oenone,&rdquo; which he began writing there; &ldquo;The Lotos-Eaters,&rdquo; which was inspired by a waterfall in the mountains; and &ldquo;The Eagle,&rdquo; which was born from the sight of the great birds circling above them as they climbed in the rocks. Above all, the little village of Cauteretz and the valley in which it lay remained more emotionally charged for Tennyson than any other place on earth. He came again and again to walk in the valley, and it provided him with imagery until his death more than 60 years later.\r\n\r\nEarly the following year Tennyson had to leave Cambridge because of the death of his father. Dr. Tennyson had totally deteriorated mentally and physically, and he left little but debts to his family, although he had enjoyed a good income and a large allowance from his father. Tennyson&rsquo;s grandfather naturally felt that it was hardly worth his while to keep Alfred and his two elder brothers at Cambridge when it was only too apparent that they were profiting little from their studies and showed no promise of ever being able to support themselves. The allowance he gave the family was generous enough, but it was not intended to support three idle grandsons at the university. Worse still, neither he nor Dr. Tennyson&rsquo;s brother Charles, who was now clearly marked out as the heir to his fortune, attended the rector&rsquo;s funeral, making the division in the family even more apparent. The widow and her 11 children were so improvident that they seemed incapable of living on the allowance, and they were certainly not able to support themselves otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis began a very bitter period of Tennyson&rsquo;s life. An annual gift of &pound;100 from an aunt allowed him to live in a modest manner, but he refused his grandfather&rsquo;s offer to help him find a place in the church if he would be ordained. Tennyson said then, as he said all his life, that poetry was to be his career, however bleak the prospect of his ever earning a living. His third volume of poetry was published at the end of 1832, although the title page was dated 1833.\r\n\r\nThe 1832&nbsp;Poems&nbsp;was a great step forward poetically and included the first versions of some of Tennyson&rsquo;s greatest works, such as &ldquo;The Lady of Shalott,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Palace of Art,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Dream of Fair Women,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hesperides,&rdquo; and three wonderful poems conceived in the Pyrenees, &ldquo;Oenone,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lotos-Eaters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mariana in the South.&rdquo; The volume is notable for its consideration of the opposed attractions of isolated poetic creativity and social involvement; the former usually turns out to be the more attractive course, since it reflected Tennyson&rsquo;s own concerns, but the poems demonstrate as well his feeling of estrangement in being cut off from his contemporaries by the demands of his art.\r\n\r\nThe reviews of the volume were almost universally damning. One of the worst was written by Edward Bulwer (later Bulwer-Lytton), who was a friend of Tennyson&rsquo;s uncle Charles. The most vicious review, however, was written for the&nbsp;Quarterly Review&nbsp;by John Wilson Croker, who was proud that his brutal notice of &ldquo;Endymion&ldquo; years before was said to have been one of the chief causes of the death of Keats. Croker numbered Tennyson among the Cockney poets who imitated Keats, and he made veiled insinuations about the lack of masculinity of both Tennyson and his poems. Tennyson, who was abnormally thin-skinned about criticism, found some comfort in the steady affection and support of Hallam and the other Apostles.\r\n\r\nHallam and Emily Tennyson had by then made their engagement public knowledge, but they saw no way of marrying for a long time: the senior Hallam refused to increase his son&rsquo;s allowance sufficiently to support both of them; and when Arthur wrote to Emily&rsquo;s grandfather, he was answered in the third person with the indication that old Mr. Tennyson had no intention of giving them any more money. By the summer of 1833, Hallam&rsquo;s father had somewhat grudgingly accepted the engagement, but still without offering further financial help. The protracted unhappiness of both Arthur and Emily rubbed off on the whole Tennyson family.\r\n\r\nThat autumn, in what was meant as a gesture of gratitude and reconciliation to his father, Arthur Hallam accompanied him to the Continent. In Vienna Arthur died suddenly of apoplexy resulting from a congenital malformation of the brain. Emily Tennyson fell ill for nearly a year; the effects of Hallam&rsquo;s death were less apparent externally in Alfred but were perhaps even more catastrophic than for his sister.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the deaths of his father and his best friend, the brutal reviews of his poetry, his conviction that both he and his family were in desperate poverty, his feelings of isolation in the depths of the country, and his ill-concealed fears that he might become a victim of epilepsy, madness, alcohol, and drugs, as others in his family had, or even that he might die like Hallam, was more than enough to upset the always fragile balance of Tennyson&rsquo;s emotions. &ldquo;I suffered what seemed to me to shatter all my life so that I desired to die rather than to live,&rdquo; he said of that period. For a time he determined to leave England, and for 10 years he refused to have any of his poetry published, since he was convinced that the world had no place for it.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was adamant about not having it published, Tennyson continued to write poetry; and he did so even more single-mindedly than before. Hallam&rsquo;s death nearly crushed him, but it also provided the stimulus for a great outburst of some of the finest poems he ever wrote, many of them connected overtly or implicitly with the loss of his friend. &ldquo;Ulysses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tithonus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tiresias,&rdquo; &ldquo;Break, break, break,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh! that &#39;twere possible&rdquo; all owe their inception to the passion of grief he felt but carefully hid from his intimates. Most important was the group of unlinked poems he began writing about Hallam&rsquo;s death; the first of these &ldquo;elegies,&rdquo; written in four-line stanzas of iambic tetrameter, was begun within two or three days of his hearing the news of Hallam&rsquo;s death. He continued to write them for 17 years before collecting them to form what is perhaps the greatest of Victorian poems,&nbsp;In Memoriam&nbsp;(1850).\r\n\r\nThe death of his grandfather in 1835 confirmed Tennyson&rsquo;s fear of poverty, for the larger part of Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s fortune went to Alfred&rsquo;s uncle Charles, who promptly changed his name to Tennyson d&rsquo;Eyncourt and set about rebuilding his father&rsquo;s house into a grand Romantic castle, with the expectation of receiving a peerage to cap the family&rsquo;s climb to eminence. His hopes were never realized, but his great house, Bayons Manor, became a model for the home of the vulgar, nouveau riche characters in many of Tennyson&rsquo;s narrative poems, such as&nbsp;Maud&nbsp;(1855). Charles Tennyson d&rsquo;Eyncourt&rsquo;s inheritance was the final wedge driving the two branches of the family apart; he and his nephew were never reconciled, but Alfred&rsquo;s dislike of him was probably even more influential than admiration would have been in keeping Charles as an immediate influence in so much of Alfred&rsquo;s poetry.\r\n\r\nThe details of Tennyson&rsquo;s romantic attachments in the years after Hallam&rsquo;s death are unclear, but he apparently had at least a flirtation with Rosa Baring, the pretty young daughter of a great banking family. Tennyson wrote a dozen or so poems to her, but it is improbable that his affections were deeply involved. The poems suggest that her position made it impossible for him to be a serious suitor to her, but she may have been more important to him as a symbol of wealth and unavailability than as a flesh-and-blood young woman. Certainly, he seems not to have been crushed when she married another man.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, however, at the age of 27, Tennyson became seriously involved with Emily Sellwood, who was four years younger than he. By the following year they considered themselves engaged. Emily had been a friend of Tennyson&rsquo;s sisters, and one of her own sisters married his next older (and favorite) brother, Charles. Most of the correspondence between Tennyson and Emily has been destroyed, but from what remains it is clear that she was very much in love with him, although he apparently withheld himself somewhat in spite of his affection for her. He was worried about not having enough money to marry, but he seems also to have been much concerned with the trances into which he was still falling, which he thought were connected with the epilepsy from which other members of the family suffered. To marry, he thought, would mean passing on the disease to any children he might father.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1840 Tennyson broke off all relations with Emily. She continued to think of herself as engaged to him, but he abandoned any hope of marriage, either then or in the future. To spare her further embarrassment, the story was put out that her father had forbidden their marriage because of Tennyson&rsquo;s poverty; this legend has been perpetuated in the present century.\r\n\r\nThrough the second half of the 1830s and most of the 1840s Tennyson lived an unsettled, nomadic life. Nominally he made his home with his mother and his unmarried brothers and sisters, who continued to rent Somersby rectory until 1837, then moved successively to Essex and to Kent; but he was as often to be found in London, staying in cheap hotels or cadging a bed from friends who lived there. He was lonely and despondent, and he drank and smoked far too much. Many of those who had known him for years believed that his poetic inspiration had failed him and that his great early promise would remain unfulfilled; but this was to neglect the fact that when all else went wrong, he clung to the composition of poetry. He was steadily accumulating a backlog of unpublished poems, and he continued adding to his &ldquo;elegies&rdquo; to Hallam&rsquo;s memory.\r\n\r\nOne of the friends who worried away at Tennyson to have his work published was Edward FitzGerald, who loved both the poems and their author, although he was too stubborn to hide his feelings when a particular poem failed to win his approval. &ldquo;Old Fitz&rdquo; nagged at Tennyson, who in the spring of 1842 agreed to break his 10 long years of silence.\r\n\r\nThe two volumes of&nbsp;Poems&nbsp;(1842) were destined to be the best-loved books Tennyson ever wrote. The first volume was made up of radically revised versions of the best poems from the 1832 volume, most of them in the form in which they are now known. The second volume contained new poems, among them some of those inspired by Hallam&rsquo;s death, as well as poems of widely varying styles, including the dramatic monologue &ldquo;St. Simeon Stylites&rdquo;; a group of&nbsp;Arthurian&nbsp;poems; his first attempt to deal with rampant sexuality, &ldquo;The Vision of Sin&rdquo;; and the implicitly autobiographical narrative &ldquo;Locksley Hall,&rdquo; dealing with the evils of worldly marriages, which was to become one of his most popular poems during his lifetime.\r\n\r\nAfter the reception of the 1832&nbsp;Poems&nbsp;and after being unpublished for so long, Tennyson was naturally apprehensive about the reviews of the new poems; but nearly all were enthusiastic, making it clear that he was now the foremost poet of his generation.&nbsp;Edgar Allan Poe&nbsp;wrote guardedly, &ldquo;I am not sure that Tennyson is not the greatest of poets.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut the bad luck that Tennyson seemed to invite struck again just as the favorable reviews were appearing. Two years earlier, expecting to make a fortune, he had invested his patrimony in a scheme to manufacture cheap wood carvings by steamdriven machines. In 1842 the scheme crashed, taking with it nearly everything that Tennyson owned, some &pound;4,000. The shock set back any progress he had made in his emotional state over the past ten years, and in 1843 he had to go into a &ldquo;hydropathic&rdquo; establishment for seven months of treatment in the hope of curing his deep melancholia.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of several stays in &ldquo;hydros&rdquo; during the next five years. Copious applications of water inside and out, constant wrappings in cold, wet sheets, and enforced abstinence from tobacco and alcohol seemed to help him during each stay; but he would soon ruin any beneficial effects by his careless life once he had left the establishment, resuming his drinking and smoking to the despair of his friends. A rather more effective form of treatment was the &pound;2,000 he received from an insurance policy at the death of the organizer of the woodcarving scheme. In 1845 he was granted a government civil list pension of &pound;200 a year in recognition of both his poetic achievements and his apparent financial need. Tennyson was in reality released from having to worry about money, but the habit of years was too much for him; for the rest of his life he complained constantly of his poverty, although his poetry had made him a rich man by the time of his death. In 1845 the betterment of his fortunes brought with it no effort to resume his engagement to Emily Sellwood, showing that it was not financial want that kept them apart.\r\n\r\nThe Princess, which was published on Christmas 1847, was Tennyson&rsquo;s first attempt at a long narrative poem, a form that tempted him most of his life although it was less congenial to him temperamentally than the lyric. The ostensible theme is the education of women and the establishment of female colleges, but it is clear that Tennyson&rsquo;s interest in the subject runs out before the poem does, so that it gradually shifts to the consideration of what he thought of as the unnatural attempt of men and women to fulfill identical roles in society; only as the hero becomes more overtly masculine and the heroine takes on the traditional attributes of women is there a chance for their happiness. Considerably more successful than the main narrative are the thematic lyrics that Tennyson inserted into the action to show the growth of passion, and between the cantos to indicate that the natural end of the sexes is to be parents of another generation in a thoroughly traditional manner. These interpolated lyrics include some of his most splendid short poems, such as &ldquo;Come down, O maid,&rdquo; &ldquo;Now sleeps the crimson petal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet and low,&rdquo; &ldquo;The splendour falls on castle walls,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tears, idle tears.&rdquo; The emotion of these lyrics does more than the straight narrative to convey the forward movement of the entire poem, and their brief perfection indicates well enough that his genius lay there rather than in the descriptions of persons and their actions; this was not, however, a lesson that Tennyson himself was capable of learning. The seriousness with which the reviewers wrote of the poem was adequate recognition of his importance, but many of them found the central question of feminine education to be insufficiently considered. The first edition was quickly sold out, and subsequent editions appeared almost every year for several decades.\r\n\r\nTennyson&rsquo;s last stay in a hydropathic hospital was in the summer of 1848, and though he was not completely cured of his illness, he was reassured about its nature. The doctor in charge apparently made a new diagnosis of his troubles, telling him that what he suffered from was not epilepsy but merely a form of gout that prefaced its attacks by a stimulation of the imagination that is very like the &ldquo;aura&rdquo; that often warns epileptics of the onset of a seizure. The trances that he had thought were mild epileptic fits were in fact only flashes of illumination over which he had no reason to worry. Had it been in Tennyson&rsquo;s nature to rejoice, he could have done so at this time, for there was no longer any reason for him to fear marriage, paternity, or the transmission of disease to his offspring. The habits of a lifetime, however, were too ingrained for him to shake them off at once. The real measure of his relief at being rid of his old fear of epilepsy is that he soon set about writing further sections to be inserted into new editions of&nbsp;The Princess, in which the hero is said to be the victim of &ldquo;weird seizures&rdquo; inherited from his family; at first he is terrified when he falls into trances, but he is at last released from the malady when he falls in love with Princess Ida. Not only this poem, but his three other major long works,&nbsp;In Memoriam, Maud, and&nbsp;Idylls of the King&nbsp;(1859), all deal in part with the meaning of trances, which are at first frightening but then are revealed to be pathways to the extrasensory, to be rejoiced over rather than feared. After his death Tennyson&rsquo;s wife and son burned many of his most personal letters, and in what remains there is little reference to his trances or his recovery from them; but the poems bear quiet testimony to the immense weight he must have felt lifted from his shoulders when he needed no longer worry about epilepsy.\r\n\r\nTennyson&rsquo;s luck at last seemed to be on the upturn. At the beginning of 1849 he received a large advance from his publisher with the idea that he would assemble and polish his &ldquo;elegies&rdquo; on Hallam, to be published as a whole poem. Before the year was over he had resumed communication with Emily Sellwood, and by the beginning of 1850 he was speaking confidently of marrying. On June&nbsp;1, In Memoriam&nbsp;was published, and less than two weeks later he and Emily were married quietly at Shiplake Church. Improbable as it might seem for a man to whom little but bad fortune had come, both events were total successes.\r\n\r\nThe new Mrs. Tennyson was 37 years old and in delicate health, but she was a woman of iron determination; she took over the running of the externals of her husband&rsquo;s life, freeing him from the practical details at which he was so inept. Her taste was conventional, and she may have curbed his religious questioning, his mild bohemianism, and the exuberance and experimentation of his poetry, but she also brought a kind of peace to his life without which he would not have been able to write at all. There is some evidence that Tennyson occasionally chafed at the responsibilities of marriage and paternity and at the loss of the vagrant freedom he had known, but there is nothing to indicate that he ever regretted his choice. It was probably not a particularly passionate marriage, but it was full of tenderness and affection. Three sons were born, of whom two, Hallam and Lionel, survived.\r\n\r\nAfter a protracted honeymoon of some four months in the Lake District, Tennyson returned to the south of England to find that the publication of&nbsp;In Memoriam&nbsp;had made him, without question, the major living poet. It had appeared anonymously, but his authorship was an open secret.\r\n\r\nThis vast poem (nearly 3,000 lines) is divided into 131 sections, with prologue and epilogue; the size is appropriate for what it undertakes, since in coming to terms with loss, grief, and the growth of consolation, it touches on most of the intellectual issues at the center of the Victorian consciousness: religion, immortality, geology, evolution, the relation of the intellect to the unconscious, the place of art in a workaday world, the individual versus society, the relation of man to nature, and as many others. The poem grew out of Tennyson&rsquo;s personal grief, but it attempts to speak for all men rather than for one. The structure often seems wayward, for in&nbsp;T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s famous phrase, it has &ldquo;only the unity and continuity of a diary&rdquo; instead of the clear direction of a philosophical statement. It had been composed with no regard for either chronology or continuity and was for years not intended to be published. The vacillation in mood of the finished poem, however, is neither haphazard nor capricious, for it is put together to show the wild swoops between depression and elation that grief brings, the hesitant gropings toward philosophical justification of bereavement, the tentative little darts of conviction that may precede a settled belief in a beneficent world. It is intensely personal, but one must also believe Tennyson in his reiterated assertions that it was a poem, not the record of his own grief about Hallam; in short, that his own feelings had prompted the poem but were not necessarily accurately recorded in it.\r\n\r\nTo the most perceptive of the Victorians (and to modern readers) the poem was moving for its dramatic recreation of a mind indisposed to deal with the problems of contemporary life, and for the sheer beauty of so many of its sections. To a more naive, and far larger, group of readers it was a work of real utility, to be read as a manual of consolation, and it is surely to that group that the poem owed its almost unbelievable popularity. Edition followed edition, and each brought Tennyson more fame and greater fortune.\r\n\r\nWordsworth, who had been poet laureate for seven years, had died in the spring of 1850. By the time Tennyson returned from his honeymoon, it must have seemed to many a foregone conclusion that he would be nominated as Wordsworth&rsquo;s successor, and early the following year he was presented to the queen as her poet laureate. He wore the borrowed and too-tight court clothes that Wordsworth had worn for the same purpose on the occasion of his own presentation as an emblem of the office&rsquo;s passage from the greatest of Romantic poets to the greatest of the Victorians.\r\n\r\nAt the end of November 1853 Alfred and Emily Tennyson moved into the secluded big house on the Isle of Wight known as Farringford, which has ever since been associated with his name. Emily loved the remoteness and the fact that their clocks were not even synchronized with those elsewhere, but her husband sometimes longed to be rattling around London. Most of the time, however, he was content to walk on the great chalk cliffs overlooking the sea, composing his poems as he tramped, their rhythm often deriving from his heavy tread.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps his very isolation that made him so interested in the Crimean War, for he read the newspapers voraciously in order to keep current with world affairs. &ldquo;The Charge of the Light Brigade&rdquo; was one result in 1854 of his fascination with the heroism of that unpopular war.&nbsp;Maud, in which the hero redeems his misspent life by volunteering for service in the Crimea, was published the following year. In spite of that somewhat conventional-sounding conclusion, the poem is Tennyson&rsquo;s most experimental, for it tells a thoroughly dramatic narrative in self-contained lyrics; the reader must fill in the interstices of the story by inference. As always, Tennyson is not at his best in narrative, but the melodramatic content of the plot finally matters little in comparison with the startling originality of his attempt to extend the limits of lyricism in order to make it do the work of narrative and drama, to capitalize on his own apparently circumscribed gift in order to include social criticism, contemporary history, and moral comment in the lyric. In part it must have been a deliberate answer to those who complained that his art was too self-absorbed and negligent of the world around him.\r\n\r\nThe experimental quality of&nbsp;Maud&nbsp;has made it one of the most interesting of his poems to modern critics, but to Tennyson&rsquo;s contemporaries it seemed so unlike what they expected from the author of&nbsp;In Memoriam&nbsp;that they could neither understand nor love it. The result was the worst critical abuse that Tennyson received after that directed at the 1832&nbsp;Poems. One reviewer went so far as to say that&nbsp;Maud&nbsp;had one extra vowel in the title, and that it made no difference which was to be deleted. Tennyson&rsquo;s predictable response was to become defensive about the poem and to read it aloud at every opportunity in order to show how badly misunderstood both poem and poet were. Since it was a performance that took between two and three hours, the capitulation to its beauty that he often won thereby was probably due as much to weariness on the part of the hearer as to intellectual or aesthetic persuasion.\r\n\r\nEver since the publication of the 1842&nbsp;Poems&nbsp;Tennyson had been something of a lion in literary circles, but after he became poet laureate he was equally in demand with society hostesses, who were more interested in his fame than in his poetic genius. For the rest of his life Tennyson was to be caught awkwardly between being unable to resist the flattery implied by their attentions and the knowledge that their admiration of him usually sprang from the wrong reasons. It was difficult for him to refuse invitations, but he felt subconsciously impelled when he accepted them to behave gruffly, even rudely, in order to demonstrate his independence. These invitations brought out the least attractive side of a fundamentally shy man, whose paroxysms of inability to deal with social situations made him seem selfish, bad-mannered, and overly assertive. In order to smooth his ruffled feathers, his hostesses and his friends would resort to heavy flattery, which only made him appear more arrogant. One of the saddest aspects of Tennyson&rsquo;s life is that his growing fame was almost in inverse ratio to his ability to maintain intimacy with others, so that by the end of his life he was a basically lonely man. All the innate charm, humor, intelligence, and liveliness were still there, but it took great understanding and patience on the part of his friends to bring them into the open.\r\n\r\nIdylls of the King&nbsp;was published in 1859; it contained only four (&quot;Enid,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vivien,&rdquo; &ldquo;Elaine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guinevere&rdquo;) of the eventual 12 idylls. The matter of Arthur and Camelot had obsessed Tennyson since boyhood, and over the years it became a receptacle into which he poured his deepening feelings of the desecration of decency and of ancient English ideals by the gradual corruption of accepted morality. The decay of the Round Table came increasingly to seem to him an apt symbol of the decay of 19th-century England. It was no accident that the first full-length idyll had been &ldquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur,&rdquo; which ultimately became&mdash;with small additions&mdash;the final idyll in the completed cycle. It had been written at the time of the death of Arthur Hallam, who seemed to Tennyson &ldquo;Ideal manhood closed in real man,&rdquo; as he wrote of King Arthur; no doubt both Hallam&rsquo;s character and Tennyson&rsquo;s grief at his death lent color to the entire poem.\r\n\r\nLike&nbsp;The Princess, In Memoriam, and&nbsp;Maud, the idylls were an assembly of poetry composed over a long time&mdash;in this case nearly half a century in all, for they were not finished until 1874 and were not all published until 1885. Taken collectively, they certainly constitute Tennyson&rsquo;s most ambitious poem, but not all critics would agree that the poem&rsquo;s success is equal to its intentions.\r\n\r\nFor a modern reader, long accustomed to the Arthurian legend by plays, musicals, films, and popular books, it is hard to realize that the story was relatively unfamiliar when Tennyson wrote. He worked hard at his preparation, reading most of the available sources, going to Wales and the west country of England to see the actual places connected with Arthur, and even learning sufficient Welsh to read some of the original documents. &ldquo;There is no grander subject in the world,&rdquo; he wrote, and he meant his state of readiness to be equal to the loftiness of his themes, which explains in part why it took him so long to write the entire poem.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tennyson always thought of the idylls as allegorical (his word was &ldquo;parabolic&rdquo;), he refused to make literal identifications between incidents, characters, or situations in the poems and what they stood for, except to indicate generally that by King Arthur he meant the soul and that the disintegration of the court and the Round Table showed the disruptive effect of the passions.\r\n\r\nIn all the time that he worked on the idylls Tennyson constantly refined their structure&mdash;by framing the main action between the coming of Arthur and his death, by repetition of verbal motifs, by making the incidents of the plot follow the course of the year from spring to winter, by making different idylls act as parallels or contrasts to each other, by trying to integrate the whole poem as closely as an extended musical composition. Considering how long he worked on the poem, the result is amazingly successful, although perhaps more so when the poem is represented schematically than in the actual experience of reading it.\r\n\r\nAs always, the imagery of the poem is superb. It is less successful in characterization and speech, which are often stilted and seem more Victorian than Arthurian. Even Arthur, who is meant to be the firm, heroic center of the poem, occasionally seems merely weak at the loss of his wife and the decay of the court rather than nobly forgiving. Individual idylls such as &ldquo;The Last Tournament&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gareth and Lynette&rdquo; have considerable narrative force, but there is an almost fatal lack of forward movement in the poem as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some adverse reviews and the reservations of many of Tennyson&rsquo;s fellow poets, the sales of&nbsp;Idylls of the King&nbsp;in 1859 were enough to gladden the heart of any poet: 40,000 copies were printed initially and within a week or two more than a quarter of these were already sold; it was a pattern that was repeated with each succeeding volume as they appeared during the following decades.\r\n\r\nThe death of his admirer Prince Albert in 1861 prompted Tennyson to write a dedication to the&nbsp;Idylls of the King&nbsp;in his memory. The prince had taken an interest in Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry ever since 1847, when it is believed that he called on Tennyson when the poet was ill. He had written to ask for Tennyson&rsquo;s autograph in his own copy of&nbsp;Idylls of the King, and he had come over unannounced from Osborne, the royal residence on the Isle of Wight, to call on Tennyson at Farringford. In spite of the brevity of their acquaintance and its formality, Tennyson had been much moved by the prince&rsquo;s kindness and friendliness, and he had greatly admired the way Albert behaved in the difficult role of consort.\r\n\r\nFour months after Albert&rsquo;s death the queen invited Tennyson to Osborne for an informal visit. Tennyson went with considerable trepidation, fearful that he might in some way transgress court etiquette, but his obvious shyness helped to make the visit a great success. It became the first of many occasions on which he visited the queen, and a genuine affection grew up on both sides. The queen treated Tennyson with what was great informality by her reserved standards, so that the relationship between monarch and laureate was probably more intimate than it has ever been before or since. She had an untutored and naive love of poetry, and he felt deep veneration for the throne; above all, each was a simple and unassuming person beneath a carapace of apparent arrogance, and each recognized the true simplicity of the other. It was almost certainly the queen&rsquo;s feeling for Tennyson that lay behind the unprecedented offer of a baronetcy four times beginning in 1865; Tennyson each time turned it down for himself while asking that if possible it be given to Hallam, his elder son, after his own death.\r\n\r\nHis extraordinary popularity was obvious in other ways as well. He was given honorary doctorates by Oxford and Edinburgh universities; Cambridge three times invited him to accept an honorary degree, but he modestly declined. The greatest men in the country competed for the honor of meeting and entertaining him.&nbsp;Thomas Carlyle&nbsp;and his wife had been good friends of Tennyson&rsquo;s since the 1840s, and Tennyson felt free to drop in on them unannounced, at last even having his own pipe kept for him in a convenient niche in the garden wall. He had met&nbsp;Robert Browning&nbsp;at about the same time as he had met Carlyle, and though the two greatest of Victorian poets always felt a certain reserve about each other&rsquo;s works, their mutual generosity in acknowledging genius was exemplary. Tennyson was somewhat lukewarm in his response to the overtures of friendship made by&nbsp;Charles Dickens, even after he had stood as godfather for one of Dickens&rsquo;s sons. It is tempting to think that some of his reserve stemmed from an uneasy recognition of the similarity of their features that occasionally led to their being confused, particularly in photographs or portraits, which can hardly have been welcome to Tennyson&rsquo;s self-esteem.\r\n\r\nTennyson maintained a reluctant closeness with William Gladstone for nearly 60 years. It was generally accepted in London society that if a dinner was given for one of them, the other ought to be invited. Yet the truth was that they were never on an easy footing, and though they worked hard at being polite to each other, their edginess occasionally flared into unpleasantness before others. It is probable that some of their difficulties came from their friendship with Arthur Hallam when they were young men; Gladstone had been Hallam&rsquo;s best friend at Eton and felt left out after Hallam met Tennyson. To the end of their days the prime minister and the poet laureate were mildly jealous of their respective places in Hallam&rsquo;s affections so many years before. The feeling certainly colored Gladstone&rsquo;s reactions to Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry (which he occasionally reviewed), and nothing he could do ever made Tennyson trust Gladstone as a politician.\r\n\r\nAlmost as if he felt that his position as laureate and the most popular serious poet in the English-speaking world were not enough, Tennyson deliberately tried to widen his appeal by speaking more directly to the common people of the country about the primary emotions and affections that he felt he shared with them. The most immediate result of his wish to be &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s poet&rdquo; was the 1864 volume whose title poem was &ldquo;Enoch Arden&rdquo; and which also contained another long narrative poem, &ldquo;Aylmer&rsquo;s Field.&rdquo; These are full of the kinds of magnificent language and imagery that no other Victorian poet could have hoped to produce, but the sentiments occasionally seem easy and secondhand. The volume also contained a number of much more experimental translations and metrical innovations, as well as such wonderful lyrics as &ldquo;In the Valley of Cauteretz,&rdquo; which was written 31 years after he and Hallam had wandered through that beautiful countryside, and &ldquo;Tithonus.&rdquo; There was no question that Tennyson was still a very great poet, but his ambition to be more than a lyricist often blinded him to his own limitations. His hope of becoming &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s poet&rdquo; was triumphantly realized; the volume had the largest sales of any during his lifetime. More than 40,000 copies were sold immediately after publication, and in the first year he made more than &pound;8,000 from it, a sum equal to the income of many of the richest men in England.\r\n\r\nPopularity of the kind he had earned had its innate disadvantages, and Tennyson was beginning to discover them as he was followed in the streets of London by admirers; at Farringford he complained of the total lack of privacy when the park walls were lined with craning tourists who sometimes even came up to the house and peered into the windows to watch the family at their meals. In 1867 he built a second house, Aldworth, on the southern slopes of Blackdown, a high hill near Haslemere, where the house was not visible except from miles away. Curiously, the house resembles a smaller version of Bayons Manor, the much-hated sham castle his uncle Charles Tennyson d&rsquo;Eyncourt had built in the Lincolnshire wolds. To his contemporaries it appeared unnecessarily grand for a second house, even slightly pretentious; today it seems emblematic of the seriousness with which Tennyson had come to regard his own public position in Victorian England, which was not his most attractive aspect. For the rest of his life he was to divide his time between Farringford and Aldworth, just as he divided his work between the essentially private, intimate lyricism at which he had always excelled and the poetry in which he felt obliged to speak to his countrymen on more public matters.\r\n\r\nIn the years between 1874 and 1882 Tennyson made yet another attempt to widen his poetic horizons. As the premier poet of England, he had been compared&mdash;probably inevitably&mdash;to Shakespeare, and he determined to write for the stage as his great predecessor had done. At the age of 65 he wrote his first play as a kind of continuation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s historical dramas.&nbsp;Queen Mary&nbsp;(1875) was produced in 1876 by Henry Irving, the foremost actor on the English stage; Irving himself played the main male role. It had been necessary to hack the play to a fraction of its original inordinate length in order to play it in one evening, and the result was hardly more dramatic than the original long version had been. In spite of the initial curiosity about Tennyson&rsquo;s first play, the audiences soon dwindled, and it was withdrawn after 23 performances; that was, however, a more respectable run than it would be today.\r\n\r\nHis next play,&nbsp;Harold&nbsp;(1876), about the early English king of that name, failed to find a producer during Tennyson&rsquo;s lifetime, although he had conscientiously worked at making it less sprawling than its predecessor.&nbsp; Following&nbsp;Harold came&nbsp;Becket (1884), The Falcon&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Cup&nbsp;(published together in 1884),&nbsp;The Foresters&nbsp;(1892), and&nbsp;The Promise of May&nbsp;(published in&nbsp;Locksley Hall Sixty Years After, Etc.&nbsp;in 1886), all of which abandoned the attempt to follow Shakespeare. On the stage only&nbsp;The Cup&nbsp;had any success, and that was in part due to the lavish settings and the acting of Irving and Ellen Terry. After the failure of&nbsp;The Promise of May&nbsp;(a rustic melodrama and the only prose work in his long career), Tennyson at last accepted the fact that nearly a decade of his life had been wasted in an experiment that had totally gone amiss. Today no one would read even the best of the plays,&nbsp;Queen Mary&nbsp;and&nbsp;Becket, if they were not Tennyson&rsquo;s work. They betray the fact that he was not profound at understanding the characters of other persons or in writing speech that had the sound of conversation. Even the flashes of metaphor fail to redeem this reckless, admirable, but totally failed attempt to fit Tennyson&rsquo;s genius to another medium.\r\n\r\nThe climax of public recognition of Tennyson&rsquo;s achievement came in 1883 when Gladstone offered him a peerage. After a few days of consideration Tennyson accepted. Since he was nearly 75 when he assumed the title, he took little part in the activities of the House of Lords, but the appropriateness of his being ennobled was generally acknowledged. It was the first time in history that a man had been given a title for his services to poetry. Tennyson claimed that he took the peerage on behalf of all literature, not as personal recognition.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his life was spent in the glow of love that the public occasionally gives to a distinguished man who has reached a great age. He continued to write poetry nearly as assiduously as he had when young, and though some of it lacked the freshness of youth, there were occasional masterpieces that mocked the passing years. He had always felt what he once described as the &ldquo;passion of the past,&rdquo; a longing for the days that had gone, either the great ages of earlier history or the more immediate past of his own life, and his poetic genius always had something nostalgic, even elegiac, at its heart. Many of the finest poems of his old age were written in memory of his friends as they died off, leaving him increasingly alone.\r\n\r\nOf all the blows of mortality, the cruelest was the death from &ldquo;jungle fever&rdquo; of his younger son, Lionel, who had fallen ill in India and was returning by ship to England. Lionel died in the Red Sea, and his body was put into the waves &ldquo;Beneath a hard Arabian moon/And alien stars.&rdquo; It took Tennyson two years to recover his equanimity sufficiently to write the poem from which those lines are taken: the magnificent elegy dedicated &ldquo;To the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava,&rdquo; who had been Lionel&rsquo;s host in India. Hauntingly, the poem is written in the same meter as&nbsp;In Memoriam, that masterpiece of his youth celebrating the death of another beloved young man, Arthur Hallam. There were also fine elegies to his brother Charles, to FitzGerald, and to several others, indicating the love he had felt for old friends even when he was frequently unable to express it adequately in person.\r\n\r\nLionel&rsquo;s death was the climax of Tennyson&rsquo;s sense of loss, and from that time until his own death he became increasingly troubled in his search for the proofs of immortality, even experimenting with spiritualism. His poetry of this period is saturated with the desperation of the search. Yet there were moments of serenity, reflected in such beautiful poems as &ldquo;Crossing the Bar,&rdquo; written in a few minutes as he sailed across the narrow band of water separating the Isle of Wight from the mainland. At his request, this grave little prayer of simple faith has ever since been placed at the end of editions of his poetry.\r\n\r\nTennyson continued to compose poetry during the last two years of his life; when he was too weak to write it down, his son or his wife would copy it for him. When he had a good day, he was still able to take long walks or even to venture to London. The year before his death he wrote a simple and delicate little poem, &ldquo;June&nbsp;Bracken and Heather,&rdquo; as an offering of love to his faithful wife; to her he dedicated his last volume of poetry, which was not published until a fortnight after his death. His friends noticed that he was gentler than he had been for years, and he made quiet reparation to some of those whom he had offended by thoughtless brusqueness.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, 1892, an hour or so after midnight, he died at Aldworth with the moon streaming in at the window overlooking the Sussex Weald, his finger holding open a volume of Shakespeare, his family surrounding the bed. A week later he was buried in the Poets&rsquo; Corner of Westminster Abbey, near the graves of Browning and Chaucer. To most of England it seemed as if an era in poetry had passed, a divide as great as that a decade later when Queen Victoria died.\r\n\r\nOne of the most levelheaded assessments of what he had meant to his contemporaries was made by Edmund Gosse on the occasion of Tennyson&rsquo;s 80th birthday: &ldquo;He is wise and full of intelligence; but in mere intellectual capacity or attainment it is probable that there are many who excel him. This, then, is not the direction in which his greatness asserts itself. He has not headed a single moral reform nor inaugurated a single revolution of opinion; he has never pointed the way to undiscovered regions of thought; he has never stood on tip-toe to describe new worlds that his fellows were not tall enough to discover ahead. In all these directions he has been prompt to follow, quick to apprehend, but never himself a pioneer. Where then has his greatness lain? It has lain in the various perfections of his writing. He has written, on the whole, with more constant, unwearied, and unwearying excellence than any of his contemporaries. &hellip; He has expended the treasures of his native talent on broadening and deepening his own hold upon the English language, until that has become an instrument upon which he is able to play a greater variety of melodies to perfection than any other man.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut this is a kind of perfection that is hard to accept for anyone who is uneasy with poetry and feels that it ought to be the servant of something more utilitarian. Like most things Victorian, Tennyson&rsquo;s reputation suffered an eclipse in the early years of this century. In his case the decline was more severe than that of other Victorians because he had seemed so much the symbol of his age, so that for a time his name was nearly a joke. After two world wars had called into question most of the social values to which he had given only the most reluctant of support, readers were once more able to appreciate that he stood apart from his contemporaries. Now one can again admire without reservation one of the great lyric gifts in English literature.\r\n\r\nWhen the best of his poetry is separated out from the second-rate work of the kind that any writer produces, Tennyson can be seen plainly as one of the half-dozen great poets in the English language, probably far above any other Victorian. And that is precisely what his contemporaries thought.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson   FRS  ( / \u02c8 t \u025b n \u026a s \u0259n / ; 6 August 1809 \u2013 6 October 1892) was an English poet. He was the  Poet Laureate  during much of  Queen Victoria 's reign. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the  Chancellor's Gold Medal  at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". He published his first solo collection of poems,  Poems, Chiefly Lyrical , in 1830. \" Claribel \" and \" Mariana \", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including  Samuel Taylor Coleridge . Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood .Tennyson also excelled at short lyrics, such as \" Break, Break, Break \", \" The Charge of the Light Brigade \", \" Tears, Idle Tears \", and \" Crossing the Bar \". Much of his verse was based on  classical  mythological themes, such as \" Ulysses \". \" In Memoriam A.H.H. \" was written to commemorate his friend  Arthur Hallam , a fellow poet and student at  Trinity College, Cambridge , after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. [2]  Tennyson also wrote some notable  blank verse  including  Idylls of the King , \"Ulysses\", and \" Tithonus \". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.A number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplace in the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" (\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\"), \"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in  The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations . [3]Tennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in  Somersby, Lincolnshire , England. [4]  He was born into a successful middle-class family of minor landowning status distantly descended from  John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers , and  Francis Leke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale . [5]His father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778\u20131831), was an Anglican clergyman who served as rector of Somersby (1807\u20131831), also rector of  Benniworth  (1802\u20131831) and  Bag Enderby , and vicar of  Grimsby  (1815). He raised a large family and \"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman, and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at  Mablethorpe  and  Skegness  on the eastern coast of England\". George Clayton Tennyson was elder son of attorney and  MP  George Tennyson (1749/50-1835),  JP ,  DL , of  Bayons Manor  and  Usselby  Hall, who had also inherited the estates of his mother's family, the Claytons, and married Mary, daughter and heiress of John Turner, of  Caistor , Lincolnshire. George Clayton Tennyson was however pushed into a career in the church and passed over as heir in favour of his younger brother,  Charles Tennyson d'Eyncourt . [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth (1781\u20131865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734\u20131799), vicar of  St. James Church, Louth  (1764) and rector of  Withcall  (1780), a small village between  Horncastle  and  Louth . Tennyson's father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers,  Charles Tennyson Turner , later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's  future wife ; the other was  Frederick Tennyson . Another of Tennyson's brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.Tennyson was a student of  King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth  from 1816 to 1820. [11]  He entered  Trinity College, Cambridge , in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the  Cambridge Apostles . [12]  A portrait of Tennyson by  George Frederic Watts  is in Trinity's collection. [13]At Cambridge, Tennyson met  Arthur Hallam  and  William Henry Brookfield , who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of \"his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles\" entitled  Poems by Two Brothers , published in 1827. [11]In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the  Chancellor's Gold Medal  at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". [14] [15]  Reportedly, \"it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor's gold medal\". [11]  He published his first solo collection of poems,  Poems Chiefly Lyrical  in 1830. \" Claribel \" and \" Mariana \", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including  Samuel Taylor Coleridge .In the spring of 1831, Tennyson's father died, requiring him to leave  Cambridge  before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family.  Arthur Hallam  came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson's sister, Emilia Tennyson.The May Queen \n \nYOU must wake and call me early, call me early,  \n     mother dear; \nTo-morrow 'll be the happiest time of all the glad  \n     new-year, - \nOf all the glad new-year, mother, the maddest,  \n     merriest day; \nFor I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to  \n     be Queen o' the May. \n \nAs I came up the valley, whom think ye should  \n     I see \nBut Robin leaning on the bridge beneath the  \n     hazel-tree? \nHe thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave  \n     him yesterday, - \nBut I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to  \n     be Queen o' the May. \n \nThey say he's dying all for love, - but that can  \n     never be; \nThey say his heart is breaking, mother, - what  \n     is that to me? \nThere's many a bolder lad 'll woo me any sum- \n     mer day; \nAnd I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to  \n     be Queen o' the May. \n \nIf I can, I'll come again, mother, from out my  \n     resting-place; \nThough you'll not see me, mother, I shall look  \n     upon your face; \nThough I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken  \n     what you say, \nAnd be often, often with you when you think I'm  \n     far away.  \n \nSo now I think my time is near; I trust it is.  \n     I know \nThe blessed music went that way my soul will  \n     have to go. \nAnd for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day; \nBut Effie, you must comfort her when I am past  \n     away. \n \nAnd say to Robin a kind word, and tell him not  \n     to fret; \nThere's many worthier than I, would make him  \n     happy yet. \nIf I had lived - I cannot tell - I might have  \n     been his wife; \nBut all these things have ceased to be, with my  \n     desire of life. \n \nForever and forever, all in a blessed home, \nAnd there to wait a little while till you and  \n     Effie come, - \nTo lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your  \n     breast, - \nAnd the wicked cease from troubling, and the  \n     weary are at rest.From \"The May Queen\" poem by Alfred Tennyson [16]In 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of \" The Lady of Shalott \". The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a  cerebral haemorrhage  while on a holiday in  Vienna . Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In the Valley of Cauteretz\" and \" In Memoriam A.H.H. \", a long poem detailing the \"Way of the Soul\". [17]Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park,  High Beach , deep within  Epping Forest ,  Essex , about 1837. Tennyson's son recalled: \"there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...\". [17]  Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet  John Clare . [18]  An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. [17]  According to Tennyson's grandson  Sir Charles Tennyson , Tennyson met  Thomas Carlyle  in 1839, if not earlier. [19]  The pair began a lifelong friendship, and were famous smoking companions. Some of Tennyson's work even bears the influence of Carlyle and his ideas. [20]  Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at  Chapel House, Twickenham .On 14 May 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two volume  Poems , of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as \" Locksley Hall \", \" Break, Break, Break \", and \" Ulysses \", and a new version of \" The Lady of Shalott \", have met enduring fame. \" The Princess: A Medley \", a satire on women's education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics.  W. S. Gilbert  later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in  The Princess  (1870) and in  Princess Ida  (1884).It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, \" In Memoriam A.H.H. \", dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed  Poet Laureate , succeeding  William Wordsworth . In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married  Emily Sellwood , whom he had known since childhood, in the village of  Shiplake . They had two sons,  Hallam Tennyson  (b. 11 August 1852)\u2014named after his friend\u2014and Lionel (b. 16 March 1854).Tennyson rented  Farringford House  on the  Isle of Wight  in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856. [21]  He eventually found that there were too many  starstruck  tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to  Aldworth , in  West Sussex  in 1869. [22]  However, he retained Farringford, and regularly returned there to spend the winters.In 1850, after William Wordsworth's death and  Samuel Rogers ' refusal, Tennyson was appointed to the position of  Poet Laureate ;  Elizabeth Barrett Browning  and  Leigh Hunt  had also been considered. [23]  He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position, such as by authoring a poem of greeting to  Princess Alexandra of Denmark  when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King  Edward VII . In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \" The Charge of the Light Brigade \", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in  an ill-advised charge  on 25 October 1854, during the  Crimean War . Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition\".Tennyson declined a  baronetcy  offered him by  Disraeli  in 1865 and 1868, finally accepting a  peerage  in 1883 at  Gladstone 's earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him  Baron Tennyson , of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of  Freshwater in the Isle of Wight . [24]  He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884. [11]Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose \"Form, Riflemen, Form\", on the French crisis of 1859 and the  Creation of the Volunteer Force , to \"Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering\", deploring Gladstone's  Home Rule Bill . Tennyson's family were  Whigs  by tradition and Tennyson's own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the  Liberal Party  after the Whigs dissolved. [25] [26]  Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. [25]  Upon passage of the  1832 Reform Act , Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration. [25]Virginia Woolf  wrote a play called  Freshwater , showing Tennyson as host to his friends  Julia Margaret Cameron  and  G. F. Watts . [27]  Colonel  George Edward Gouraud ,  Thomas Edison 's European agent, made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry, late in his life. They include recordings of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", and excerpts from \"The splendour falls\" (from The Princess), \"Come into the garden\" (from  Maud ), \"Ask me no more\", \"Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Lancelot and Elaine\". The sound quality is poor, as wax cylinder recordings usually are.Towards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his \"religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and  pandeism \": [28]  In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief. [29]  Famously, he wrote in  In Memoriam : \"There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.\" In  Maud , 1855, he wrote: \"The churches have killed their Christ\". In \" Locksley Hall Sixty Years After \", Tennyson wrote: \"Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate.\" In his play,  Becket , he wrote: \"We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven\". Tennyson recorded in his  Diary  (p. 127): \"I believe in  Pantheism  of a sort\". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised  Giordano Bruno  and  Spinoza  on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, \"His view of God is in some ways mine\", in 1892. [30]Tennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth, aged 83. He was buried at  Westminster Abbey . [31]  A memorial was erected in  All Saints' Church, Freshwater . His last words were, \"Oh that press will have me now!\". [32]  He left an estate of \u00a357,206. [33]   Tennyson Down  and the  Tennyson Trail  on the Isle of Wight are named after him, and a monument to him stands on top of Tennyson Down.  Lake Tennyson  in New Zealand's high country, named by  Frederick Weld , is assumed to be named after Lord Tennyson. [34]He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son,  Hallam , who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second  Governor-General of Australia .Although  Albert, Prince Consort , was largely responsible for Tennyson's appointment as Laureate, [23]   Queen Victoria  became an ardent admirer of Tennyson's work, writing in her diary that she was \"much soothed & pleased\" by reading \" In Memoriam A.H.H. \" after Albert's death. [35]The two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, \"very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair & a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him.\" [36]Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" had been. [37]As source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of  John Keats  and other  Romantic poets  published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. [38]  He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of  Break, Break, Break  emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of \"I come from haunts of coot and hern\" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of \"Come down O maid from yonder mountain height\" illustrate his telling combination of  onomatopoeia ,  alliteration , and  assonance :The moan of doves in immemorial elms \nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary  Robert Browning  as \"insane\", symptomatic of \"mental infirmity\". [39]  His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and words, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. [40]  Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of  metre ; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the  quantitative metres  of Greek and Latin poetry to English. [41]  He reflects the  Victorian period  of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among  Victorian writers  in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. [42]  Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his \"Englishness\" and his masculinity. [43]  Well-known among his longer works are  Maud  and  Idylls of the King , the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of  King Arthur  and the  Knights of the Round Table . A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including  Mariana ,  The Lotos Eaters ,  Tears, Idle Tears ,  In Memoriam ), possibly reflecting Tennyson's own lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. [44]  T. S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as \"the saddest of all English poets\", whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a \"surface\" to his poetry's \"depths, to the abyss of sorrow\". [45]  Other poets such as  W. H. Auden  maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the \"stupidest\" of all the English poets, adding that: \"There was little about melancholia he didn't know; there was little else that he did.\" [46]Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . In 1848,  Dante Gabriel Rossetti  and  William Holman Hunt  made a list of \"Immortals\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including  Keats  and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings. [47]   The Lady of Shalott  alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt,  John William Waterhouse  (three versions), and  Elizabeth Siddall .A  heraldic achievement  of Alfred, Lord Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of  Trinity College, Cambridge , showing arms:Gules, a bend nebuly or thereon a  chaplet  vert between three leopard's faces  jessant-de-lys  of the second ;  Crest :  A  dexter  arm in armour the hand in a gauntlet or grasping a broken tilting spear enfiled with a garland of laurel ;  Supporters :  Two  leopards rampant guardant  gules sem\u00e9e de lys and ducally crowned or ; Motto:  Respiciens Prospiciens [48]  (\"Looking backwards (is) looking forwards\").These are a  difference  of the arms of  Thomas Tenison  (1636\u20131715),  Archbishop of Canterbury , themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century  Denys family  of  Glamorgan  and  Siston  in Gloucestershire, themselves a difference of the arms of  Thomas de Cantilupe  (c. 1218\u20131282),  Bishop of Hereford , henceforth the arms of the  See of Hereford ; the name \"Tennyson\" signifies \"Denys's son\", although no connection between the two families is recorded.A list of works by Tennyson follows: [49] [50].",
        "response": " Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, was an English poet who served as the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign. He was born in 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England, to a middle-class family with minor landowning status. Tennyson's father, George Clayton Tennyson, was an Anglican clergyman who raised a large family and encouraged his children's interest in writing. Tennyson and two of his brothers published a collection of poems in 1827, and Tennyson went on to attend Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles.\n\nIn 1829, Tennyson won the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for his poem \"Timbuktu.\" He published his first solo collection of poems, \"Poems Chiefly Lyrical,\" in 1830, which included well-known works such as \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana.\" Despite some criticism, his verse became popular and brought him to the attention of established writers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson's early poetry was influenced by medievalism and powerful visual imagery, which later inspired the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\n\nIn 1833, Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which included the first version of \"The Lady of Shalott.\" However, the volume met heavy criticism, and Tennyson did not publish again for ten years, though he continued to write. That same year, his close friend Arthur Hallam died suddenly, which had a profound impact on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\"\n\nTennyson moved around frequently during this period, eventually settling in London in 1840. In 1842, he published the two-volume \"Poems,\" which included new works like \"Locksley Hall\" and \"Break, Break, Break,\" as well as revised versions of earlier poems. These volumes were well-received, and Tennyson's reputation as a poet grew.\n\nIn 1850, Tennyson reached a pinnacle in his career with the publication of \"In Memoriam A.H.H.,\" a long poem commemorating Hallam's death. That same year, he was appointed Poet Laureate, succeeding William Wordsworth. He also married Emily Sellwood, his childhood friend, and settled in Farringford House on the Isle of Wight.\n\nTennyson continued to write and publish throughout his life, producing notable works like \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" and \"Maud.\" He was made Baron Tennyson in 1883 and held the position of Poet Laureate until his death in 1892. Tennyson's poetry is known for its rich imagery, rhythm, and exploration of themes like nature, loss, and melancholy. He is considered one of the greatest Victorian poets and has left a lasting legacy in English literature.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Algernon Charles Swinburne, English poet and critic, was born on April 5, 1837, in London. His family, aristocratic on both sides, divided their time between family estates in Northumberland and the Isle of Wight. The dramatic landscapes of these two homes would later influence his poetry.He attended Eton beginning in 1849, and in 1856 he matriculated at Oxford University as a student in Balliol College. There, he became friends with the Pre-Raphaelite painters and joined an undergraduate group of intellectuals who called themselves the \u201cOld Mortality.\u201d While he began writing both poetry and criticism at Oxford, he left without a degree in 1859 and moved to London.The literary social life that Swinburne began at Oxford extended to his life in London, where he frequented parties and associated with many cultural figures. He published his first book, a collection of two dramas titled The Queen-Mother and Rosamond (B. M. Pickering, 1860). His two subsequent dramas, Atalanta in Calydon (Edward Moxon, 1865) and Chastelard (E. P. Dutton, 1866), were received more positively in his literary spheres, but it was not until 1866 that his career catapulted with the publication of his first poetry collection.Poems and Ballads (Edward Moxon, 1866) had a notable impact on Victorian poetry with its groundbreaking portrayal of sexuality and taboo. Swinburne is known for the sensation that this book produced in the literary community, but also for the range of his subsequent poetry collections. He published several more books of poetry, including the political Songs Before Sunrise (F. S. Ellis, 1871) and the French-influenced Poems and Ballads, Second Series (Chatto and Windus, 1878).He was also the author of an influential body of literary criticism, of which T. S. Eliot wrote, \u201cwhatever our opinion of Swinburne\u2019s verse, the notes upon poets by a poet of Swinburne\u2019s dimensions must be read with attention and respect.\u201dAfter his health deteriorated in the 1870s, he moved to Putney to live with his close friend Theodore Watts-Dunton. While he continued to write, it is argued that the quality of his work declined in this later period. He died in London on April 10, 1909.Renowned Victorian author Lewis Carroll is known for his comic fantasies and humorous, childlike verse.\u00a0Born in 1809, Alfred Lord Tennyson is one of the most well-loved Victorian poets.Robert Seymour Bridges was born on October 23, 1844, in Walmer, Kent, England. He enrolled in Eton College in 1854 and started writing poetry.George Meredith was born in Portsmouth, England, on February 12, 1828.Born in 1830 in London, Christina Rossetti, the author of Goblin Market and Other Poems, is a major Victorian Poet., Algernon Charles Swinburne [1837-1909] was an English poet, playwright, novelist, and critic. He was the author of several novels, and contributed the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature every year from 1903 to 1907 and again in 1909.Swinburne was born into an old aristocratic family.  He was sent to Eton, where he acquired a taste for flagellation, and Oxford, where he became friends with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, of which he was briefly a member. \r\nHis second volume of poetry, a drama in classical style, brought him praise.  His next two volumes, Poems and Ballads (1866), were heavily influenced by de Sade, Baudelaire, and the French symbolists.\n\r\nThis work was reviled by critics, most famously by Robert Buchanan, who attacked Swinburne and Rossetti in \"The Fleshly School of Poetry,\" though it influenced contemporaries like Wilde and Yeats and modernists such as Joyce and T.S. Eliot. Swinburne suffered a breakdown in the 1870s but continued to write, in genres ranging from lyric poetry and satire to pornography, for the remainder of his life.  Much of his work remains unpublished., English poet and critic Algernon Charles Swinburne was born into a wealthy Northumbrian family in London, England in 1837. He was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford, but did not complete a degree. Swinburne was one of the most accomplished lyric poets of the Victorian era and was a preeminent symbol of rebellion against the conservative values of his time. His books include Poems and Ballads, Second Series (1878), Songs Before Sunrise (1871), Poems and Ballads (1866), Chastelard (1865), Atalanta in Calydon (1865), and The Queen-Mother and Rosamond (1860).\r\n\r\nThe explicit and often pathological sexual themes of his most important collection of poetry, Poems and Ballads (1866), delighted some, shocked many, and became the dominant feature of Swinburne&rsquo;s image as both an artist and an individual. Nevertheless, critics have found that to focus exclusively on the sensational aspects of Swinburne&rsquo;s work is to miss the assertion, implicit in his poetry and explicit in his critical writings, that his primary preoccupation was the nature and creation of poetic beauty.\r\n\r\nWhile at Oxford, Swinburne met the brothers William Michael and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, as well as other members of the Pre-Raphaelite circle, a group of artists and writers whose work emphasized medieval subjects, elaborate religious symbolism, and a sensual pictorialism, and who cultivated an aura of mystery and melancholy in their lives as well as in their works. In 1860 Swinburne published two verse dramas in the volume The Queen-Mother and Rosamond, which was largely ignored. He achieved his first literary success in 1865 with Atalanta in Calydon, which was written in the form of classical Greek tragedy. The following year the appearance of Poems and Ballads brought Swinburne instant notoriety. He became identified with the &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; themes and the precept of art for art&rsquo;s sake that characterized many of the poems in the volume. He subsequently wrote poetry of many different kinds, including the militantly republican Song of Italy (1867) and Songs before Sunrise (1871) in support of the risorgimento, the movement for Italian political unity, as well as nature poetry. Although individual volumes of Swinburne&rsquo;s poetry were occasionally well received, in general his popularity and critical reputation declined following the initial sensation of Poems and Ballads.\r\n\r\nSwinburne&rsquo;s physical appearance, his personality, and the facts of his life have received much attention from biographers and from commentators exploring biographical bases of his works. He was small, frail, and plagued by numerous peculiarities of physique and temperament, including an overlarge head, nervous gestures, and seizures that may have been manifestations of a form of epilepsy. Throughout the 1860s and 1870s, he drank excessively and was prone to accidents that often left him bruised, bloody, or unconscious. Until his 40s, he suffered intermittent physical collapses that necessitated removal to his parents&rsquo; home while he recovered. In 1879, Swinburne&rsquo;s friend and literary agent, Theodore Watts-Dunton, intervened during a time when Swinburne was dangerously ill. Watts-Dunton isolated Swinburne at a suburban home in Putney and gradually weaned him from alcohol&mdash;and from many former companions and habits as well. Swinburne lived another 30 years with Watts-Dunton, whose role remains controversial. He denied Swinburne&rsquo;s friends access to him, controlled the poet&rsquo;s money, and restricted his activities. However, commentators agree that Swinburne&rsquo;s erratic conduct could have resulted in his death, and Watts-Dunton is generally credited with saving his life and encouraging him to continue writing into his old age. Swinburne died in London on April 10, 1909 at the age of 72.\r\n\r\nThe most important and conspicuous quality of Swinburne&rsquo;s work is an intense lyricism. Even early critics, who often took exception to his subject matter, commended his intricately extended and evocative imagery, metrical virtuosity, rich use of assonance and alliteration, and bold, complex rhythms. At the same time, the strong rhythms of his poems and his characteristic use of alliteration were sometimes carried to extremes and rendered his work highly susceptible to parody. Critics note that his usually effective imagery is at times vague and imprecise, and his rhymes are sometimes facile and uninspired. After establishing residence in Putney, Swinburne largely abandoned the themes of pathological sexuality that had characterized much of his earlier poetry. Nature and landscape poetry began to predominate, as well as poems about children. Many commentators maintain that the poetry written during the years at Putney is inferior to Swinburne&rsquo;s earlier work, but others have identified individual poems of exceptional merit among his later works, citing in particular &ldquo;By the North Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evening on the Broads,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Nympholept,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lake of Gaube,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Neap-Tide.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThroughout his career Swinburne also published literary criticism of great acuity. His familiarity with a wide range of world literatures contributed to a critical style rich in quotation, allusion, and comparison. He is particularly noted for discerning studies of Elizabethan dramatists and of many English and French poets and novelists. In response to criticism of his own works, Swinburne wrote essays, including Notes on Poems and Reviews (1866) and Under the Microscope (1872), which are celebrated for their wit and insight. Swinburne also published one novel, Love&rsquo;s Cross-Currents (1901), serially under a pseudonym, and left another, Lesbia Brandon, unfinished at his death. The first attracted little notice other than some speculation about its authorship. Some critics have theorized that Lesbia Brandon was intended as thinly disguised autobiography; however, its fragmentary form resists conclusive interpretation.\r\n\r\nDuring Swinburne&rsquo;s lifetime, critics considered Poems and Ballads his finest as well as his most characteristic poetic achievement; subsequent poetry and work in other genres was often disregarded. Since the mid-20th century, however, commentators have been offering new assessments of Swinburne&rsquo;s entire career. Forgoing earlier dismissals of Swinburne&rsquo;s voluminous later writings and reexamining individual poems strictly on their own merit, critics have identified works of great power and beauty from all periods of his career., Algernon Charles Swinburne  (5 April 1837 \u2013 10 April 1909) was an English poet, playwright, novelist and critic. He wrote several novels and collections of poetry such as  Poems and Ballads , and contributed to the  Eleventh Edition  of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica .Swinburne wrote about many  taboo  topics, such as  lesbianism ,  sado-masochism , and  anti-theism . His poems have many common motifs, such as the ocean, time, and death. Several historical people are featured in his poems, such as  Sappho  (\"Sapphics\"),  Anactoria  (\"Anactoria\"),  and  Catullus  (\"To Catullus\"). [1]Swinburne was born at 7 Chester Street,  Grosvenor Place , London, on 5 April 1837. He was the eldest of six children born to Captain (later Admiral) Charles Henry Swinburne (1797\u20131877) and Lady Jane Henrietta, daughter of the  3rd Earl of Ashburnham , a wealthy  Northumbrian  family. He grew up at East Dene in  Bonchurch  on the  Isle of Wight . [2]  The Swinburnes also had a London home at Whitehall Gardens, Westminster. [3]As a child, Swinburne was \"nervous\" and \"frail\", but \"was also fired with nervous energy and fearlessness to the point of being reckless.\" [4]  He went riding and wrote plays with his first cousin  Mary Gordon  who lived nearby on the Isle of Wight. They secretly collaborated on her second book,  Children of the Chapel , which contained an unusual amount of beatings. [5]Swinburne attended  Eton College  (1849\u201353), where he started writing poetry. At Eton, he won first prizes in French and Italian. [4]  He attended  Balliol College, Oxford  (1856\u201360), with a brief hiatus when he was  rusticated [6]  from the university in 1859 for having publicly supported the attempted assassination of  Napoleon III  by  Felice Orsini . [7]  He returned in May 1860, though he never received a degree.Swinburne spent summer holidays at  Capheaton Hall  in  Northumberland , the house of his grandfather,  Sir John Swinburne, 6th Baronet  (1762\u20131860), who had a famous library and was president of the  Literary and Philosophical Society  in  Newcastle upon Tyne . Swinburne considered Northumberland to be his native county, an emotion reflected in poems like the intensely patriotic \"Northumberland\", \" Grace Darling \" and others. He enjoyed riding his pony across the moors; he was a daring horseman, \"through honeyed leagues of the northland border\", as he called the Scottish border in his  Recollections . [8]In the period 1857\u201360, Swinburne became a member of  Lady Trevelyan 's intellectual circle at  Wallington Hall .After his grandfather's death in 1860 he stayed with  William Bell Scott  in Newcastle. In 1861, Swinburne visited  Menton  on the  French Riviera , staying at the Villa Laurenti to recover from the excessive use of alcohol. [9]  From Menton, Swinburne travelled to  Italy , where he journeyed extensively. [9]  In December 1862, Swinburne accompanied Scott and his guests, probably including  Dante Gabriel Rossetti , on a trip to  Tynemouth . Scott writes in his memoirs that, as they walked by the sea, Swinburne declaimed the as yet unpublished \" Hymn to Proserpine \" and \"Laus Veneris\" in his lilting intonation, while the waves \"were running the whole length of the long level sands towards  Cullercoats  and sounding like far-off acclamations\". [10]At Oxford, Swinburne met several  Pre-Raphaelites , including Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He also met  William Morris . After leaving college, he lived in London and started an active writing career, where Rossetti was delighted with his \"little Northumbrian friend\", probably a reference to Swinburne's diminutive height\u2014he was just 5'4\". [12]Swinburne was an  alcoholic  and  algolagniac  and highly excitable. He liked to be  flogged . [13]  His health suffered, and in 1879 at the age of 42, he was taken into care by his friend,  Theodore Watts-Dunton , who looked after him for the rest of his life at  The Pines , 11 Putney Hill,  Putney . [14]  Watts-Dunton took him to the lost town of  Dunwich , on the Suffolk coast, on several occasions in the 1870s. [15]In Watts-Dunton's care Swinburne lost his youthful rebelliousness and developed into a figure of social respectability. [1]  It was said of Watts-Dunton that he saved the man and killed the poet. Swinburne died at the Pines [16] :\u200axii\u200a  on 10 April 1909, at the age of 72, and was buried at  St. Boniface Church, Bonchurch  on the  Isle of Wight . [17]Swinburne's poetic works include:  Atalanta in Calydon  (1865),  Poems and Ballads  (1866),  Songs before Sunrise  (1871),  Poems and Ballads Second Series , (1878)  Tristram of Lyonesse  (1882),  Poems and Ballads Third Series  (1889), and the novel  Lesbia Brandon  (published posthumously in 1952).Poems and Ballads  caused a sensation when it was first published, especially the poems written in homage to  Sappho of Lesbos  such as \" Anactoria \" and \" Sapphics \": Moxon and Co. transferred its publication rights to  John Camden Hotten . [18]  Other poems in this volume such as \"The Leper\", \"Laus Veneris\", and \"St Dorothy\" evoke a Victorian fascination with the  Middle Ages , and are explicitly  mediaeval  in style, tone and construction. Also featured in this volume are \" Hymn to Proserpine \", \" The Triumph of Time \" and \" Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs) \".Swinburne wrote in a wide variety of forms, including  Sapphic stanzas  (comprising 3  hendecasyllabic  lines followed by an  Adonic ):So the goddess fled from her place, with awful \nSound of feet and thunder of wings around her; \nWhile behind a clamour of singing women \n     Severed the twilight. [19]Swinburne devised the poetic form called the  roundel , a variation of the French  Rondeau , and examples of this form were included in  A Century of Roundels  dedicated to  Christina Rossetti .

        "reflected_response": " Algernon Charles Swinburne, the Victorian era poet and dramatist, is renowned for his bold, sensual, and unconventional style. Born in 1837, in London, England, Swinburne's childhood was marked by instability and tragedy. His father, a naval officer, died when he was a child, and his mother struggled with mental illness. Despite these challenges, Swinburne demonstrated exceptional literary talent from a young age. He attended Eton College and later studied at Balliol College, Oxford, where he excelled academically and socially, befriending future Prime Minister William Gladstone and other prominent figures. Known for his rebellious nature, Swinburne often challenged social norms and conventions, reflecting this in his literary works. His poetry, characterized by its musical quality and experimental form, explored themes of sensuality, sadomasochism, and power dynamics. Swinburne's dramatic works, including his most famous, \"Atalanta in Calydon,\" showcased his innovative use of verse and his fascination with Greek mythology. In addition to his literary achievements, Swinburne led a colorful life, involving political activism, a passionate affair with a married woman, and a close friendship with fellow poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Swinburne's unconventional lifestyle and provocative writings established him as one of the most intriguing and influential Victorian poets."

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Algernon Charles Swinburne  (5 April 1837 \u2013 10 April 1909) was an English poet, playwright, novelist and critic. He wrote several novels and collections of poetry such as  Poems and Ballads , and contributed to the  Eleventh Edition  of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica .Swinburne wrote about many  taboo  topics, such as  lesbianism ,  sado-masochism , and  anti-theism . His poems have many common motifs, such as the ocean, time, and death. Several historical people are featured in his poems, such as  Sappho  (\"Sapphics\"),  Anactoria  (\"Anactoria\"),  and  Catullus  (\"To Catullus\"). [1]Swinburne was born at 7 Chester Street,  Grosvenor Place , London, on 5 April 1837. He was the eldest of six children born to Captain (later Admiral) Charles Henry Swinburne (1797\u20131877) and Lady Jane Henrietta, daughter of the  3rd Earl of Ashburnham , a wealthy  Northumbrian  family. He grew up at East Dene in  Bonchurch  on the  Isle of Wight . [2]  The Swinburnes also had a London home at Whitehall Gardens, Westminster. [3]As a child, Swinburne was \"nervous\" and \"frail\", but \"was also fired with nervous energy and fearlessness to the point of being reckless.\" [4]  He went riding and wrote plays with his first cousin  Mary Gordon  who lived nearby on the Isle of Wight. They secretly collaborated on her second book,  Children of the Chapel , which contained an unusual amount of beatings. [5]Swinburne attended  Eton College  (1849\u201353), where he started writing poetry. At Eton, he won first prizes in French and Italian. [4]  He attended  Balliol College, Oxford  (1856\u201360), with a brief hiatus when he was  rusticated [6]  from the university in 1859 for having publicly supported the attempted assassination of  Napoleon III  by  Felice Orsini . [7]  He returned in May 1860, though he never received a degree.Swinburne spent summer holidays at  Capheaton Hall  in  Northumberland , the house of his grandfather,  Sir John Swinburne, 6th Baronet  (1762\u20131860), who had a famous library and was president of the  Literary and Philosophical Society  in  Newcastle upon Tyne . Swinburne considered Northumberland to be his native county, an emotion reflected in poems like the intensely patriotic \"Northumberland\", \" Grace Darling \" and others. He enjoyed riding his pony across the moors; he was a daring horseman, \"through honeyed leagues of the northland border\", as he called the Scottish border in his  Recollections . [8]In the period 1857\u201360, Swinburne became a member of  Lady Trevelyan 's intellectual circle at  Wallington Hall .After his grandfather's death in 1860 he stayed with  William Bell Scott  in Newcastle. In 1861, Swinburne visited  Menton  on the  French Riviera , staying at the Villa Laurenti to recover from the excessive use of alcohol. [9]  From Menton, Swinburne travelled to  Italy , where he journeyed extensively. [9]  In December 1862, Swinburne accompanied Scott and his guests, probably including  Dante Gabriel Rossetti , on a trip to  Tynemouth . Scott writes in his memoirs that, as they walked by the sea, Swinburne declaimed the as yet unpublished \" Hymn to Proserpine \" and \"Laus Veneris\" in his lilting intonation, while the waves \"were running the whole length of the long level sands towards  Cullercoats  and sounding like far-off acclamations\". [10]At Oxford, Swinburne met several  Pre-Raphaelites , including Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He also met  William Morris . After leaving college, he lived in London and started an active writing career, where Rossetti was delighted with his \"little Northumbrian friend\", probably a reference to Swinburne's diminutive height\u2014he was just 5'4\". [12]Swinburne was an  alcoholic  and  algolagniac  and highly excitable. He liked to be  flogged . [13]  His health suffered, and in 1879 at the age of 42, he was taken into care by his friend,  Theodore Watts-Dunton , who looked after him for the rest of his life at  The Pines , 11 Putney Hill,  Putney . [14]  Watts-Dunton took him to the lost town of  Dunwich , on the Suffolk coast, on several occasions in the 1870s. [15]In Watts-Dunton's care Swinburne lost his youthful rebelliousness and developed into a figure of social respectability. [1]  It was said of Watts-Dunton that he saved the man and killed the poet. Swinburne died at the Pines [16] :\u200axii\u200a  on 10 April 1909, at the age of 72, and was buried at  St. Boniface Church, Bonchurch  on the  Isle of Wight . [17]Swinburne's poetic works include:  Atalanta in Calydon  (1865),  Poems and Ballads  (1866),  Songs before Sunrise  (1871),  Poems and Ballads Second Series , (1878)  Tristram of Lyonesse  (1882),  Poems and Ballads Third Series  (1889), and the novel  Lesbia Brandon  (published posthumously in 1952).Poems and Ballads  caused a sensation when it was first published, especially the poems written in homage to  Sappho of Lesbos  such as \" Anactoria \" and \" Sapphics \": Moxon and Co. transferred its publication rights to  John Camden Hotten . [18]  Other poems in this volume such as \"The Leper\", \"Laus Veneris\", and \"St Dorothy\" evoke a Victorian fascination with the  Middle Ages , and are explicitly  mediaeval  in style, tone and construction. Also featured in this volume are \" Hymn to Proserpine \", \" The Triumph of Time \" and \" Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs) \".Swinburne wrote in a wide variety of forms, including  Sapphic stanzas  (comprising 3  hendecasyllabic  lines followed by an  Adonic ):So the goddess fled from her place, with awful \nSound of feet and thunder of wings around her; \nWhile behind a clamour of singing women \n     Severed the twilight. [19]Swinburne devised the poetic form called the  roundel , a variation of the French  Rondeau , and examples of this form were included in  A Century of Roundels  dedicated to  Christina Rossetti .  Swinburne wrote to  Edward Burne-Jones  in 1883: \"I have got a tiny new book of songs or songlets, in one form and all manner of metres ... just coming out, of which Miss Rossetti has accepted the dedication. I hope you and Georgie  [his wife Georgiana, one of the  MacDonald sisters ]  will find something to like among a hundred poems of nine lines each, twenty-four of which are about babies or small children\".

        "reflected_response": "\nSure! Here is a biography of Emily Dickinson, one of America's most renowned poets:\n\n## Early Life\n\nEmily Elizabeth Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was a lawyer and treasurer of Amherst College, and her mother, Emily Norcross Dickinson, was a deeply religious homemaker. Emily was the second of three children; she had an older brother, William Austin, and a younger sister, Lavinia Norcross.\n\n## Education\n\nDickinson received her primary education at Amherst Academy, a former secondary school with a strong reputation, from 1840 to 1847. She then attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) for a single year, from 1847 to 1848. While at Mount Holyoke, she formed a close friendship with her classmate and lifelong correspondent, Abiah Root.\n\n## Career\n\nDespite her family's wealth and social standing, Dickinson chose to lead a reclusive life, rarely venturing beyond her family's estate. She became known for her unconventional behavior and distinctive dress, often choosing to wear white clothing and a white carnation.\n\n## Poetry\n\nDickinson's poetry is unique and innovative, characterized by short lines, slant rhyme, and unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Her poems explore themes of nature, immortality, and the complexities of human emotion, often reflecting her own experiences and observations. During her lifetime, very few of her nearly 1800 poems were published, and those that were published were heavily edited without her consent. It was only after her death that the full scope of her poetic genius was recognized and appreciated.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nDickinson had a close relationship with her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert Dickinson, who encouraged her writing and served as a source of emotional support. She also exchanged letters and poems with several friends and mentors, including Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a literary critic and former army officer. Despite her reclusiveness, she maintained a rich inner life, filled with deep passions and intellectual pursuits.\n\n## Death\n\nOn May 15, 1886, Dickinson died at the age of 55 in Amherst, the place of her birth. The exact cause of her death is uncertain, though it is believed to have been either Bright's disease or influenza. She left behind a vast collection of poems, now recognized as some of the most important and influential in American literature. Her work continues to inspire and captivate readers with its profound exploration of the human condition."

        "reflected_response": " Alice N. Persons is a poet who uses her writing to explore the darker side of human experience. Her poems often delve into themes of isolation, despair, and the profound disconnect that can exist between individuals in modern society. \"Police Notes\" is a powerful example of Person's style. In this poem, she presents a series of stark images: a woman dead in her apartment, a man taking his own life in his car, and a boy hanging in his closet. These are scenes that could be taken directly from police reports, and indeed, the poem is structured as a series of excerpts from such reports. Each vignette depicts a lonely death, unnoticed and unmourned by the world at large. What is most striking is how Persons humanizes these victims, forcing the reader to confront the reality of their isolation and the tragic waste of their untold stories. Persons has a talent for uncovering the beauty and sadness in the everyday, and her work serves as a reminder that even the most solitary among us are intrinsically linked to the wider human community, whether they feel it or not. Outside of her writing, Persons leads a somewhat reclusive life. She has stated in interviews that she finds comfort in solitude and that her best work often comes from periods of isolation. This preference for seclusion extends to her public image; she rarely makes personal appearances or gives interviews, preferring to let her poetry speak for itself. Despite her reclusiveness, Persons has published several collections of poetry and has gained a dedicated following among readers who appreciate her unique perspective on the human condition."

After Berrigan's death in 1983, she married the British poet Douglas Oliver.Though Notley is often identified as a prominent member of the eclectic second generation of\u00a0The New York School, her poetry also demonstrates a continuing fascination with the desert and its inhabitants.

She has long written in narrative and epic and genre-bending modes to discover new ways to explore the nature of the self and the social and cultural importance of disobedience. The artist Rudy Burckhardt once wrote that Notley may be &ldquo;our present-day Homer.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNotley was born in Arizona and grew up in Needles, California. After earning her BA from Barnard College and MFA from the Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop, Notley traveled extensively around the U.S. and abroad.

In 1972, Berrigan and Notley married and moved to Chicago, where they lived until 1976. She&nbsp;had two sons with him, the poets Edmund and Anselm Berrigan.\r\n\r\nActive in the New York poetry scene of the 1960s and &lsquo;70s, Notley is often identified with the Second Generation New York School poets, though her work resists any period classification. In an interview with the Kenyon Review, Notley noted: &ldquo;I think I try with my poems to create a beginning space. I always seem to be erasing and starting over, rather than picking up where I left off, even if I wind up taking up the same themes. This is probably one reason that I change form and style so much, out of a desire to find a new beginning, which is always the true beginning.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nNotley is the author of over 40 books of poetry, including 165 Meeting House Lane (1971), Phoebe Light (1973), Incidentals in the Day World (1973), For Frank O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s Birthday (1976), Alice Ordered Me to Be Made: Poems 1975 (1976), Dr. Williams&rsquo; Heiresses (1980), How Spring Comes (1981), which received the San Francisco Poetry Award, Waltzing Matilda (1981), Margaret &amp; Dusty (1985), From a Work in Progress (1988), Homer&rsquo;s Art (1990), To Say You (1993), Selected Poems of Alice Notley (1993), The Descent of Alette (1996), among many others.

Notley&rsquo;s recent work includes From the Beginning (2004), Alma, or the Dead Women (2006), Grave of Light: New and Selected Poems 1970-2005, which received the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, In the Pines (2007), Culture of One (2011), Songs and Stories of the Ghouls (2011), Benediction (2015), and Certain Magical Acts (2016).\r\n\r\nReferring back to her writing in the 1970s in an interview with the Ampersand Review, Notley says she felt she was &ldquo;the only poet I knew of who used the details of pregnancy and motherhood as a direct, pervading subject in poems, on a daily basis, as if it were true that half the people in the world gave birth to others and everyone had been born.&rdquo; Poems from this time include&nbsp; &ldquo;Clinical Thermometer Set with Moonstone&rdquo; and &ldquo;How Spring Comes&rdquo;. &nbsp;In these poems, as in much of Notley&rsquo;s work, details from daily life enter in fragments that can be both entertaining and jarringly serious. Notley borrows images and inspirations from popular cultural (Muhammed Ali and Marlon Brando in &ldquo;30th&nbsp;Birthday&rdquo; and comic books in &ldquo;The Ten Best Issues of Comic Books&rdquo;), as well as the more serious literary world. &ldquo;Jack Would Speak Through the Imperfect Medium of Alice&rdquo; is an imagined rebuke by Beat writer Jack Kerouac of his biographers, many of whom focused on the lurid and sensational details of his personal life rather than the importance and impact of his writing.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn the spring of 1976, Notley and her family returned to New York, and her husband Ted fell ill with hepatitis, a disease he suffered from until his death in 1983. While not directly autobiographical, &ldquo;Sonnet&rdquo;, written in 1976, tells the story of comedian Gracie Allen&rsquo;s illness and her husband&rsquo;s efforts to nurse her back to health. Among Notley&rsquo;s most famous works is &ldquo;At Night the States&rdquo;, an elegy for Berrigan written two years after his death. The words &ldquo;at night the states&rdquo; serve as a refrain that marks the beginning of each stanza. Notley has said that her decision to place the refrain at the beginning of the stanza rather than the end is what allowed her to continue writing the poem. A fairly long poem that Notley generally reads quickly, &ldquo;At Night the States&rdquo; gives the reader a feeling of being pulled through grief and back into life, with irregular syntax signaling the disruption to day-to-day living caused by a great loss. A similar style is found in other poems from that era, including &ldquo;I the People&rdquo;.&nbsp; In this Poem Talk podcast devoted to this poem, it is read as a sort of non-political political poem, bringing the personal into the public.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter having befriended the British poet and novelist Douglas Oliver during an earlier trip to England, Notley later reconnected with him, marrying in 1988 and moving to Paris in 1992. Notley&rsquo;s writing at this time begins to shift away from singular poems and toward book-length projects with overarching styles and themes. In an important essay titled &ldquo;The Poetics of Disobedience&rdquo;, Notley says this shift began with her book The Descent of Alette (1992). She describes it as &ldquo;an immense act of rebellion against dominant social forces, against the fragmented forms of modern poetry, against the way a poem was supposed to look according to both past and contemporary practice.&rdquo; The narrator, Alette, finds herself in a feminist epic, on a subway, traveling deeper and deeper in the tunnels, into an underworld filled with caves and otherworldly characters. The text is visually striking with quotation marks surrounding each poetic foot, intended to slow the reader down and indicate the pace at which the book is to be read. The same style extends to other poems from this time period, such as &ldquo;White Phosphorus&rdquo;.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNotley&rsquo;s next book, Mysteries of Small House (1998), is an experiment with the autobiographical mode, in which Notley &ldquo;was firstly trying to realize the first person singular as fully and nakedly as possible.&rdquo; Her subsequent book, Disobedience (2001), heads in the opposite direction, showing disobedience to the notions of truth and reality, featuring comic confrontations with reoccurring characters like Robert Mitch-ham, a man that closely resembles the actor Robert Mitchum. Recent books continue to be at least somewhat character centered. Culture of One sees Notley returning to the desert of her childhood to tell the story of one of its residents.&nbsp; This &ldquo;novel in poems,&rdquo; as its jacket copy describes it, covers the life of Marie, a woman who lives in a shack in the town dump.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWith Songs and Stories of the Ghouls (2011), Notley once again takes on the challenge of creating a feminist epic. In reframing and re-empowing Dido and Medea, she is writing a meditation on destruction. &ldquo;Logic&rdquo; sees cities destroyed as poems are stolen; a bloodied performer attempts to win over a non-existent audience in &ldquo;Perhaps Not for You&rdquo;. There is, however, some hope to be found in &ldquo;Millions of Us&rdquo;, which ends &ldquo;We have this project to / change our silence into the beautiful city of a voice.&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn addition to collections of poetry, Notley has published the autobiography Tell Me Again (1982), the play Anne&rsquo;s White Glove (1985), and a book of essays on poets and poetry, Coming After (2005). She edited and wrote the introduction for the reissue of Ted Berrigan&rsquo;s The Sonnets (2000), as well as editing, with her sons, The Collected Poems of Ted Berrigan (2005). Her honors and awards include an Arts and Letters Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. She has also been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She was married the British poet Douglas Oliver until his death in 2000.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlice Notley continues to live in Paris and makes frequent trips to the U.S. to give readings and lectures. Among her two newest volumes are Eurynome&rsquo;s Sandals (Presses Universitaires de Rouen, 2019) and For the Ride (Penguin Books, 2020). In 2015, she was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, Notley was a guest blogger for&nbsp;Harriet., Alice Notley  (born November 8, 1945) is an American  poet . Notley came to prominence as a member of the second generation of the  New York School  of poetry\u2014although she has always denied being involved with the New York School or any specific movement in general. Notley's early work laid both formal and theoretical groundwork for several generations of poets; she is considered a pioneering voice on topics like motherhood and domestic life.Notley's experimentation with poetic form, seen in her books  165 Meeting House Lane ,  When I Was Alive ,  The Descent of Alette , and  Culture of One , ranges from a blurred line between genres, to a quotation-mark driven interpretation of the variable foot, to a full reinvention of the purpose and potential of strict rhythm and meter.  She also experimented with channeling spirits of deceased loved ones, primarily men gone from her life like her father and her husband, poet Ted Berrigan, and used these conversations as topics and form on her poetry. Her poems have also been compared to Gertrude Stein, as well as her contemporary Bernadette Mayer. Mayer and Notley both used their experience as mothers and wives in their work. [ citation needed ]In addition to poetry, Notley has written a book of criticism ( Coming After , University of Michigan, 2005), a play (\"Anne's White Glove\"\u2014performed at the Eye & Ear Theater in 1985), a biography ( Tell Me Again , Am Here, 1982), and she has edited three publications,  Chicago ,  Scarlet , and  Gare du Nord , the latter two co-edited with Douglas Oliver. Notley's collage art appeared in  Rudy Burckhardt 's film \"Wayward Glimpses\" and her illustrations have appeared on the cover of numerous books, including a few of her own. As is often written in her biographical notes, \"she has never tried to be anything other than a poet,\" and with over forty books and chapbooks and several major awards, she is one of the most prolific and lauded American poets today. She is a recipient of the  Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize .Notley was born on November 8, 1945, in  Bisbee, Arizona , and grew up in  Needles, California .  Notley wrote extensively of her childhood and early life in her book  Tell Me Again  (Am here, 1982).Notley left Needles for New York City to attend  Barnard College  in 1963, desiring an escape from the isolation of her hometown. [1]   She received a  Bachelor of Arts  from Barnard College in spring 1967 and left New York City that fall for the fiction program at the  Iowa Writers' Workshop . She was the only woman in her genre and one of two in the entire graduate writing department.  Notley cites\u2014in part\u2014a reading by  Robert Creeley  as early inspiration for her writing more poetry.  A close relationship with the poet  Anselm Hollo , who was teaching at the program at that time, led to Notley leaving Iowa City for Morocco in 1968.  Notley claims it was boring and returned to Iowa City where she met the poet  Ted Berrigan  who began as an instructor at the school that fall. [2]After Notley's graduation, she and Berrigan spent periods of time in New York City and Buffalo.  During the winter of 1970\u201371, Notley and Berrigan lived on Long Island, where Notley wrote her first book,  165 Meeting House Lane  (Twenty-Four Sonnets).  The book took its title from the address of their home on Long Island and was published by Berrigan's C Press.  It bears a dedication to  James Schuyler  and Anne and  Fairfield Porter , who were also residing together on Long Island at the time.  Notley also thanks  Tom Clark  who would go on to re-publish the sonnet cycle in his anthology  All Stars. [3]   Notley and Berrigan spent the several months between Long Island and Chicago in  Bolinas, California , which is where Berrigan officially printed  165 Meeting House Lane . [4]   Notley's second book, Phoebe Light, was published in 1973 by  Bill Berkson 's Bolinas-based press Big Sky. [5]In 1972, Notley married Berrigan and the two moved to Chicago where Berrigan had been given  Ed Dorn 's newly vacated teaching position at  Northeastern Illinois University .  Notley and Berrigan joined an already active community of Chicago poets, including  Paul Carroll ,  Paul Hoover , and  Maxine Chernoff . Notley gave birth to their first son,  Anselm Berrigan , named after Anselm Hollo, in 1972, as well.At Berrigan's behest, his students at Northeastern became very active members of the local poetry scene, starting magazines and reading series.  One group of students\u2014Darlene Pearlstein, Peter Kostakis, and Richard Friedman\u2014started a small poetry press, The Yellow Press, which would go on to publish two books by Notley, one book by Berrigan, and give out a yearly Ted Berrigan Prize\u2014overseen in part by Notley\u2014for a first book (though the press would cease publishing two years in).  Young poets on the Chicago scene regularly hung out with Notley and Berrigan at their home and many followed the couple back to New York City in the late 70s.  The circle of younger poets who spent time with Notley and Berrigan included the aforementioned members of the Yellow Press team, Barbara Barg, Rochelle Kraut, Rose Lesniak, Bob Rosenthal, Steve Levine, Simon Schuchat, Tim Milk, and several others. [6]While in Chicago, Notley started publishing her magazine  Chicago , a legal-sized mimeograph publication which would continue through both her pregnancies and even her relocation to England.  Notley began the magazine to connect with preexisting poet friends and meet new writers on both coasts while living in the midwest.  The magazine ran for eight issues, three of which were published while Notley and Berrigan lived in England.  Notley edited seven of the issues with Berrigan taking over one while Notley was pregnant with their first son.  The artist  George Schneeman , perhaps most famous for his artworks that appeared on the covers of dozens of books of poetry, did all of the covers for the magazine. [7]In 1974, Berrigan got a job as a visiting poet at  University of Essex , so Notley and Berrigan, with their son Anselm, relocated first to  London , then to  Brightlingsea  in  Essex . [8]   While in England, Notley would write her second sonnet cycle  Great Interiors, Wines and Spirits of the World,  which was originally published in a Notley-themed issue of the Chicago magazine Out There. [9]From February through June 1974 in  Wivenhoe , Essex, Notley wrote her book  Songs for the Unborn Second Baby  (United Artists, 1979). While Notley had written on motherhood prior to  Songs , this book was her first to focus fully on the matter and is the first full-length book of a  New York School -affiliated poet to take on the task of addressing poetry's sexism and the pressures and setbacks of motherhood in both personal and creative life. It was reissued in 2021 by the London-based small press Distance No Object. Notley gave birth to her and Berrigan's second child,  Edmund Berrigan , at Colchester Hospital in 1974.The couple returned to Chicago for a brief period of time after their year in England before moving to New York City in 1976.1976 saw Notley and Berrigan moving their family permanently to New York City's  Lower East Side , where they'd live together until Berrigan's death in 1983.  Their apartment at 101 St. Mark's Place again became a hub for both young writers and Berrigan and Notley's contemporaries.  Notley remained fairly prolific during this era, writing and publishing several full-length collections.  Perpetually strapped for cash, the two took on whatever small jobs they could to support the family.  Notley and Berrigan were frequent instructors at  Naropa University 's summer writing program. [10]   Some of Notley's most famous engagements with the poetry community while in NYC were her workshops at the  Poetry Project  at St. Mark's Church, which were attended by dozens of young poets including  Bob Holman ,  Patricia Spears Jones ,  Steve Carey , and Susie Timmons.  Eileen Myles  wrote of their experience in Notley's workshops in their books  Chelsea Girls  (Black Sparrow Press, 2004; Ecco, 2015) and  Inferno  (O/R Books, 2010). Of her 1983 workshop, Notley wrote:I expect my workshop will be similar to past Alice Notley workshops: same old format, assignments, xeroxes, forms, occasions, geometries, kinds of poems, speculations on and practice of the lofty and the silly.  I assume I've learned a little more since the last time I taught, and that I've a little more to learn in the teaching.  If not, boo hoo.  Other possible issues: goofy works, \"description,\" dreams (the new gen), school of Susie Timmons, rejuvenation of the \"found work,\" the \"line,\" how to be like Elinor [Nauen] and Maggie [Dubris], how to cultivate inventiveness, strategies for dry spell, dictionaries, diaries, little plays, calligrams, tiles, left-hand margins, how to get great theories and general self-improvement.[11]In 1986, Notley led a workshop where participants were required to write an entire book during the course of their meetings.  After the workshop ended, Notley teamed up with students to print copies of their works on the mimeograph machine in the St. Mark's basement.  The books were published under the imprint Unimproved Editions and Notley made cover art for the majority of the titles. [12]   Her own book, entitled  Parts of a Wedding,  was published first in a small edition by Unimproved Editions then later as a section of the O Books anthology  O One. [13]Berrigan's death in 1983 struck the poetry community exceptionally hard and over the next decade, Notley would suffer the loss of many others who were close to her.  Notley's 1985 play \"Anne's White Glove,\" a commission by  Ada Katz 's  Eye and Ear Theater  navigated the pain of Berrigan's death, and her collections  Margaret & Dusty  (Coffee House, 1985),  Parts of a Wedding  (Unimproved Editions, 1986), and  At Night the States  (The Yellow Press, 1987) contain material written during a period of mourning.  Notley's elegiac work during this era, including her poems \"Beginning With a Stain\" and \"At Night the States,\" is some of her most widely celebrated.In 1992, Notley moved to  Paris  with her second husband, the British poet and novelist  Douglas Oliver  (1937\u20132000), whom she met while living in England in 1974.  The two worked on two magazines together,  Gare du Nord  and  Scarlet , and self-published a compendium of their own books,  The Scarlet Cabinet,  which contained Notley's  Descent of Alette .  Descent  would grow to be Notley's most widely read and taught collection after its reprinting by Penguin in 1996. Notley has remained in Paris but makes several trips to the United States each year to give readings and teach small workshops. Some have linked Notley's geographical move to Paris\u2014since it followed a period of intensely personal writing\u2014as also marking a creative distance between herself and her poems, though her books  Mysteries of Small Houses  (Penguin, 1998) and  Culture of One  (Penguin, 2011) engage very much with personal matter.In 1999, Notley was both a finalist for the  Pulitzer Prize  and a winner of the  Los Angeles Times Book Prize  for Poetry. In spring 2001, she received an award from the  American Academy of Arts and Letters  and the  Poetry Society of America 's  Shelley Memorial Award . This period also marked an increase in scholarly interest in Notley's work.Notley has stayed very involved in the preservation of both Berrigan and Oliver's works, having edited and written introductions for a number of their books and she continues to be a prolific and powerful force in contemporary poetry, winning the Leonore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2015. [14]  Several poems from her 2007 collection  In the Pines  were set to music by the Canadian  indie pop  band  AroarA  for their  2014 Polaris Music Prize -nominated 2013 EP  In the Pines [15]  and in Fall 2014, a conference celebrating Notley's work was held at the Bay Area Public School in Oakland, California. [16]  Over two nights, November 14 and 15, 2016, Notley read  The Descent of Alette  in its entirety at  The Lab  in  San Francisco . [17].",

        "reflected_response": "\nBiography of Alice Notley:\n\nAlice Notley, a poet of remarkable versatility and depth, was born in 1945 in the small town of Bisbee, Arizona. Displaying an early talent for writing, she pursued her passion at Barnard College and the University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop, obtaining a BA and MFA in creative writing, respectively. Notley's academic pursuits, however, were interspersed with a nomadic lifestyle as she travelled across the United States with her partner, the poet Ted Berrigan. They lived in several states, including New York, Rhode Island, and California, immersing themselves in the vibrant poetry communities of each place. Bolinas, California, stands out for its notable residents, such as Joanne Kyger and Philip Whalen.\n\nNotley and Berrigan eventually settled in Chicago, marrying in 1972, and had two sons, Edmund and Anselm, both of whom followed in their parents' poetic footsteps. During this time, Notley was an active participant in the New York poetry scene, often associated with the Second Generation New York School poets. Her work, however, defies easy categorization, as she constantly pushes boundaries and explores new forms.\n\nNotley's extensive body of work includes over 40 books of poetry. Her early writing explored themes of pregnancy and motherhood, with poems like \"Clinical Thermometer Set with Moonstone\" and \"How Spring Comes.\" She masterfully weaves together the mundane and the profound, incorporating influences from daily life, popular culture, and literature. This unique style is evident in \"Jack Would Speak Through the Imperfect Medium of Alice,\" where she engages with Beat writer Jack Kerouac.\n\nReturning to New York in 1976, Notley faced personal tragedy when her husband, Ted, fell ill with hepatitis and passed away in 1983. She channelled her grief into her writing, crafting elegies like \"Sonnet,\" inspired by Gracie Allen's illness, and \"At Night the States,\" dedicated to Berrigan.\n\nIn the following years, Notley remarried the British poet and novelist Douglas Oliver, and their union led her to Paris in 1992. Her writing evolved towards book-length projects with cohesive styles and themes. \"The Descent of Alette,\" published in 1992, is a standout example, presenting a feminist epic that challenges social norms and the fragmented nature of modern poetry.\n\nNotley continued to push the boundaries of form and content in her later works. \"Mysteries of Small Houses,\" published in 1998, is an autobiographical exploration of the first-person singular. \"Disobedience\" (2001) playfully subverts notions of truth, while \"Culture of One\" (2011) is a \"novel in poems\" that tells the story of a woman named Marie through the poetry of Notley's childhood desert surroundings.\n\nNotley has also demonstrated her versatility by venturing beyond poetry into other literary forms. In addition to over 40 poetry books, she has published an autobiography, \"Tell Me Again\" (1982), a play, \"Anne's White Glove\" (1985), and a collection of essays on poets and poetry, \"Coming After\" (2005).\n\nThroughout her career, Notley has been widely recognized for her contributions to contemporary poetry, receiving prestigious awards such as the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Poetry.

        "response": "\nHere is a biography of the poet Alice Oswald, written at a length of approximately 400-800 words:\nBritish poet Alice Oswald has carved a unique path in contemporary poetry, blending classical influences with a deep engagement with nature and an innovative approach to form. Her work, which often takes the form of book-length projects, has earned her widespread acclaim and numerous awards, including the prestigious T.S. Eliot Prize and Griffin Poetry Prize.\n\nBorn Alice Priscilla Lyle Oswald on August 31, 1966, in Reading, Berkshire, England, Oswald comes from a distinguished family background. Her father, Charles William Lyle Keen, and mother, Lady Priscilla Mary Rose Curzon, was the daughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe. She attended New College at the University of Oxford, where she studied classics and developed a deep interest in ancient literature, particularly Greek and Latin texts.\n\nHowever, Oswald's path took an unexpected turn when she decided to pursue gardening. She trained as a gardener and worked at renowned sites such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, Wisley, and Clovelly Court Gardens. This immersion in the natural world would profoundly influence her poetry, infusing it with a deep ecological consciousness.\n\nOswald's debut collection, \"The Thing in the Gap-Stone Stile\" (1996), announced her arrival as a talented new voice in British poetry. The collection received a Forward Poetry Prize for Best First Collection and was also shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize in 1997. With this first book, Oswald established her interest in exploring the intersections between the natural world and human experience, a theme that would recur throughout her oeuvre.\n\nHer second book, \"Dart\" (2002), represented a significant departure from traditional poetry collections. It combined verse and prose to tell the story of the River Dart in Devon, England, from a multitude of perspectives. Oswald conducted extensive research, drawing on primary and secondary sources, to create a rich tapestry of voices and histories associated with the river. \"Dart\" was hailed as a remarkable achievement, winning the T.S. Eliot Prize in 2002 and solidifying Oswald's reputation as a poet of exceptional talent and ambition.\n\nOswald's subsequent collections further explored her interests in ecology, music, and the interplay between the natural world and human culture. \"Woods, etc.\" (2005) delved into the mysteries of forests, while \"Weeds and Wild Flowers\" (2009), illustrated by Jessica Greenman, offered a celebration of the often-overlooked beauty of weeds. \"A Sleepwalk on the Severn\" (2009) continued her engagement with rivers, this time focusing on the Severn in England and Wales.\n\nOne of Oswald's most acclaimed works is \"Memorial\" (2011), a reworking of Homer's \"Iliad.\" Departing from the narrative structure of the original epic, Oswald focuses on the individual characters whose deaths are mentioned in the poem, creating a powerful commemoration of their lives and losses. \"Memorial\" received widespread critical praise for its innovative approach and stunning imagery, winning the Warwick Prize for Writing in 2013, with Oswald becoming the first poet to receive this prestigious award.\n\nOswald has also received numerous other honors, including an Eric Gregory Award, an Arts Foundation Award for Poetry, a Forward Prize for Best Single Poem, and a Ted Hughes Award. In 2019, she made history again by becoming the first woman appointed as the Oxford University Professor of Poetry, a four-year tenure.\n\nCurrently residing in Devon with her husband, the playwright Peter Oswald, and their three children, Alice Oswald continues to create poetry that challenges conventions and explores the intricate connections between humans and the natural world. Her other notable works include \"Falling Awake\" (2016), \"Nobody\" (2019), and \"A Short Story of Falling\" (2020).",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Alicia Suskin Ostriker  (born November 11, 1937 [1] ) is an American poet and scholar who writes Jewish  feminist poetry . [2] [3]  \nShe was called \"America's most fiercely honest poet\" by  Progressive . [1]  Additionally, she was one of the first women poets in America to write and publish poems discussing the topic of motherhood. [4]  In 2015, she was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. [5]  In 2018, she was named the New York State Poet Laureate. [6]Ostriker was born in  Brooklyn, New York , to David Suskin and Beatrice Linnick Suskin. [1]   She grew up in the Manhattan housing projects during the  Great Depression . [7]  Her father worked for New York City Parks Department. Her mother read her  William Shakespeare  and  Robert Browning , and Alicia began writing poems, as well as drawing, from an early age. Initially, she had hoped to be an artist and studied art as a teenager. Her books,  Songs  (1969) and  A Dream of Springtime  (1979), spotlight her own illustrations. [8]  Ostriker went to high school at  Ethical Culture Fieldston School  in 1955.She holds a bachelor's degree from  Brandeis University  (1959), and an M.A. (1961) and Ph.D. (1964) from the  University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison . [1]  In Ostriker's first year of graduate school, she attended a conference where a visiting professor commented on her poetry by saying, \"'You women poets are very graphic, aren't you?'\" This comment caused her to reflect on the meaning of being a woman poet. She had never thought of that term before and she realized that men were uncomfortable when women wrote about their own bodies. This encounter became a defining moment in her life and from that moment on, she wrote poems discussing the various facets of a woman: sexuality, motherhood, pregnancy, and mortality. [2]  On the other hand, her doctoral dissertation, on the work of  William Blake , became her first book,  Vision and Verse in William Blake  (1965). Later, she edited and annotated Blake's complete poems for Penguin Press. [1] [8]She is married to astronomer  Jeremiah P. Ostriker , who taught at Princeton University (1971\u20132001). They have three children: Rebecca (1963),  Eve  (1965), and Gabriel (1970). [7]  She has been a resident of  Princeton, New Jersey . [9]She began her teaching career at  Rutgers University  in 1965 and has served as an English  professor  until she retired in 2004. Ostriker decided to pursue a career while also taking care of her children which was very uncommon during this time. Ostriker's ambition, desire to live a life different from her mother's, and her husband's refusal to let her become a housewife influenced her to make that choice. [4]  In 1969, her first collection of poems,  Songs , was published by  Holt, Rinehart and Winston . This collection contained poems that she wrote while she was still a student. Her poems reflect the influence poets such as Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Keats, W.H. Auden, William Blake, and Walt Whitman have had on her and her poetry. [7]Her second collection of poems published was  Once More Out of Darkness.  Majority of the poems were written in free verse. [7]  While she was writing this collection of poems, Ostriker became aware of her feminist views. The poems that compose this collection were based on her first two experiences of pregnancy and childbirth as she had her first two children 18 months apart. Discussing these topics in her poems made her cognizant of the fact that she had not previously read poems about these topics and that she was breaking a taboo. Her third volume of poems,  A Dream of Springtime,  had poems that demonstrated her growth by discussing her emerging from her past and discovering herself and her identity. [7]Her fourth book of poems,  The Mother/Child Papers  (1980), a feminist classic, was inspired by the birth of her son during the  Vietnam War  and weeks after the  Kent State shootings . Throughout, she juxtaposes musings about motherhood with musings about war. She also discusses her husband and her other two children in her poems. This collection allowed her to explore her identity as a woman by examining her role as a mother, wife, and professor. It did take her ten years to write the poems that make up this collection as she gained more inspiration from events that were happening in society such as the American Feminist movement. [7]Ostriker's books of  nonfiction  explore many of the same themes manifest in her verse. They include  Writing Like a Woman  (1983), which explores the poems of  Sylvia Plath ,  Anne Sexton ,  H.D. ,  May Swenson  and  Adrienne Rich , and  The Nakedness of the Fathers: Biblical Visions and Revisions  (1994), which approaches the  Torah  with a midrashic sensibility. [10]  She wrote the introduction to  Giannina Braschi 's  Empire of Dreams , a postmodern poetry classic of the Spanish Caribbean (1994). [11]Ostriker's sixth collection of poems,  The Imaginary Lover  (1986), won the William Carlos Williams Award of the Poetry Society of America. The poems included in this collection had a feminist voice, probably due to fact that at the same time, she was doing research for her second feminist criticism book,  Stealing the Language: the Emergence of Women Poets in America . In  The Imaginary Lover , Ostriker examines the fantasies associated with womanhood by discussing topics such as mother-daughter relationships and marriage. [7]   The Crack in Everything  (1996) was a  National Book Award  finalist, and won the Paterson Poetry Award and the San Francisco State Poetry Center Award.  The Little Space: Poems Selected and New, 1968\u20131998  was also a 1998 National Book Award finalist. [12]Green Age  (1989) was Ostriker's most visionary and successful collection of poems. Themes analyzed in this collection was time, history and politics, and inner spirituality and how these helped her heal. Ostriker highlights how there is a lack of feminist spirituality in traditional religions. [7]Ostriker's most recent nonfiction book is  For the Love of God  (2007), a work that continues her midrash exploration of biblical texts begun with  Feminist Revision and the Bible  (1993) and  The Nakedness of the Fathers:  Biblical Visions and Revisions  (1994).  Dancing at the Devil's Party  (2000) examines the work of poets from  William Blake  and  Walt Whitman  to  Maxine Kumin . Early in the introduction to the book, she disagrees with  W. H. Auden 's assertion that poetry makes nothing happen. Poetry, Ostriker writes, \"can tear at the heart with its claws, make the neural nets shiver, flood us with hope, despair, longing, ecstasy, love, anger, terror\". [13]Ostriker's poems have appeared in a wide variety of periodicals, including  The New Yorker ,  The Nation ,  Poetry ,  American Poetry Review ,  Paris Review ,  The Atlantic ,  Yale Review ,  Kenyon Review ,  Iowa Review ,  Shenandoah Review ,  Antaeus ,  Colorado Review ,  Denver  Quarterly ,  Boulevard ,  Poetry East ,  New England Review ,  Santa Monica Review ,  Triquarterly Review ,  Seneca Review ,  Ms. ,  Ontario Review ,  Bridges ,  Tikkun ,  Prairie Schooner ,  Gettysburg Review ,  Lyric ,  Fence , and  Ploughshares .A variety of Ostriker's poems have been translated into Italian, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew and Arabic.  Stealing the Language  has been translated into Japanese and published in Japan. Her fifty-year poetry career is the subject of a collection of essays by American poets and feminist literary scholars, entitled \"Every Woman Her Own Theology\".

Born on May 31, 1819, in West Hills, New York, Whitman developed a passion for literature and language at a young age, absorbing the rhythms and cadences of the King James Bible and the works of Shakespeare. As a young man, he worked as a printer's devil, setting type for local newspapers, absorbing the news of the day and honing his craft. He spent his early career as a teacher and journalist, but it was his poetry that would leave an indelible mark on the literary world. \n\nWhitman's most famous work, \"Leaves of Grass,\" is a sweeping collection of poems that explore themes of identity, nature, and the human condition. First published in 1855, \"Leaves of Grass\" underwent multiple revisions and expansions over the course of Whitman's life, reflecting his evolving thoughts and experiences. The collection is known for its innovative use of free verse, devoid of traditional rhyme and meter, allowing Whitman to capture the fluidity and spontaneity of human thought and emotion. \n\nWhat set Whitman apart was his democratic vision and his celebration of the individual. He embraced the diversity of American life, from the urban bustle of New York City to the vast expanses of the American West. He saw beauty in the common man and woman, elevating their experiences and voices in his poetry. This democratic spirit extended to his personal life as well. Whitman volunteered as a nurse during the American Civil War, tending to wounded soldiers from all walks of life, and his poetry often reflected his empathy and compassion. \n\nIn addition to his literary achievements, Whitman was also known for his unique personality and appearance. He was a tall, bearded man with a booming voice and a larger-than-life personality. He loved to walk the streets of New York, engaging strangers in conversation and reciting his poetry. He was a true bohemian, embracing a free-spirited and nonconformist lifestyle. His home became a gathering place for artists and intellectuals, fostering a sense of community that reflected his democratic ideals. \n\nDespite facing criticism and controversy during his lifetime, Whitman remained true to his unique artistic vision. His influence can be seen in the works of countless poets who followed, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest American poets of the 19th century. Today, his poetry continues to inspire and captivate readers with its timeless exploration of the human spirit. \n\nAs we reflect on the life and legacy of Walt Whitman, let us embrace the democratic spirit that infused his work and remember the power of the individual voice. May his words continue to remind us of the beauty and diversity of our shared human experience. \n\n\n\n"

[1]  They worked together for 20 years until Janet's death from cancer in 1994. He wrote the books and she illustrated them. [2]  Allan Ahlberg has also written dozens of books with other illustrators. [a]Janet Ahlberg won two  Kate Greenaway Medals  for illustrating their books [3] [4]  and the 1978 winner  Each Peach Pear Plum  was named one of the top ten winning works for the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955\u20132005). [5]  In the US it was published by  Viking Press  in 1979 as  Each Peach Pear Plum: an \"I Spy\" story ; the national library catalogue summary explains, \"Rhymed text and illustrations invite the reader to play ' I spy ' with a variety of  Mother Goose  and other folklore characters.\" [6] [7]Allan Ahlberg was born 5 June 1938 in  Croydon . [8]  An  illegitimate  child, he was adopted and brought up in  Oldbury , in  Sandwell  in the  West Midlands . [9]  He has called it \"a very poor working-class family\" and identified himself as the baby in  Peepo!  (1981). He grew up with \"no books and not much conversation\". [2]Janet Hall was born 21 October 1944 in  Yorkshire [10]  and brought up in  Leicester . [9]  The Ahlbergs both trained as teachers at  Sunderland Technical College , where they met during the 1960s and married in 1969. [9]Janet illustrated  My Growing Up Book  by Bernard Garfinkel (New York: Platt & Munk, 1972), which the US  Library of Congress  calls \"A child's record of the things he has learned and done from the time of birth through age five. Also provides a place to paste photographs.\" [11]Their joint work began when she asked him, a primary school teacher, to write a story. [2] \nThe first three published Ahlberg collaborations appeared in 1976 and 1977,  The Old Joke Book ,  The Vanishment of Thomas Tull , and  Burglar Bill  (1977). [9]   Vanishment  was bound in hardcover with a  dust jacket , while many of their early works were \"pictorial laminated boards\". [1]  For  Each Peach Pear Plum  (Kestrel), Janet won the 1978  Kate Greenaway Medal  from the British  Library Association , recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a  British subject . [3]  For the 50th anniversary of the Medal, a 2007 panel named it one of the top ten winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation's favourite. [5]   Each Peach Pear Plum  finished a close second to the 1977 medalist,  Dogger  by  Shirley Hughes ; the margin was 1% of the vote. [12]Probably their greatest success was  The Jolly Postman , published by Heinemann in 1986; Allan Ahlberg told  The Guardian  in 2006 that it had sold over six million copies. It made innovative use of envelopes to include letters, cards, games and a tiny book. [2]  According to one  WorldCat  library record,\n\"A Jolly Postman delivers letters to several famous fairy-tale characters such as the Big Bad Wolf, Cinderella, and the Three Bears. Twelve of the pages have been made into six envelopes and contain eight letters and cards. Each letter may be removed from its envelope page and read separately.\" Its first-listed  Library of Congress Subject Heading  (US) is \"Toy and movable books\". [13]The Jolly Postman  required five years to make, and much discussion with Heinemann and the printer before it was issued in 1986. It won many awards including the  Kurt Maschler Award  for integrated writing and illustration. [9] [14]  There were two sequels,  The Jolly Christmas Postman  (1991), for which Janet won her second Greenaway Medal, [4]  and  The Jolly Pocket Postman  (1995).Working together, the Ahlbergs produced many popular books for a range of ages. Some, such as  Peepo!  and  The Baby's Catalogue  are aimed at babies and toddlers. For older children, they wrote books such as  Burglar Bill ,  Cops and Robbers ,  Funnybones  and the  Happy Families  series. Allan also wrote two books of verses,  Heard it in the Playground  and  Please, Mrs Butler , which Janet illustrated, and more text-heavy books such as  Woof! . [1] [9]Janet died of breast cancer in November 1994 at the age of 50, when their daughter Jessica was 15 years old. Allan Ahlberg says with regret that they \"made an absolute fortune\" but \"never really had holidays\". [2]Allan later married his editor, Vanessa Clarke of  Walker Books , his new publisher. As of 2017, he is the author of more than 150 published books, including two in 2004 illustrated by his daughter Jessica, who now creates picture books with other writers such as  Toon Tellegen . [2] [15]  Father and daughter collaborated again, completing a  movable  picture book published late in 2012,  The Goldilocks Variations  (Walker), \"a new twist in an old fairy tale\". [16] [17]Allan Ahlberg is a supporter of  West Bromwich Albion F.C. , having grown up in the neighbouring town to  West Bromwich . [18]Beside the two Greenaway Medals, Janet Ahlberg was a \"Commended\" runner up three times, for  Burglar Bill  (1977),  The Baby's Catalogue  (1982), and  The Jolly Postman  (1986). [19] [b] \nAccording to Allan, their daughter Jessica inspired the latter two, and his own \"Burglar Bill\" book is autobiographical,  The Boyhood of Burglar Bill  (Puffin, 2007). [2]  A football story set in war-ravaged England,  Boyhood  made the  Guardian Children's Fiction Prize  shortlist. [20]Allan appeared as a castaway on the  BBC Radio  programme  Desert Island Discs  on 14 November 2008. [21]  He described their work together, her illness and death, and the creation of  Janet's Last Book . [21]From July to September 2011, Janet and Allan's work was celebrated at  The Public  arts centre in  Sandwell  (which encompasses Allan's hometown Oldbury). The exhibition included works by schoolchildren with local artists \"in response to\" Ahlberg stories. [22]In July 2014, Allan Ahlberg declined the (inaugural) Booktrust Best Book Awards 'Lifetime Achievement Award' (which has a 5000 GBP prize attached). He cited ethical grounds related to the award's principal sponsor  Amazon.com . In a letter to  The Bookseller  he stated that \"Booktrust does good work and has a well-deserved reputation ... For my part, the idea that my \"lifetime achievement\"\u2014 i.e. the books (and all of Janet's work too)\u2014should have the Amazon tag attached to it is unacceptable.\" [23] [24]Allan Ahlberg sits on the Council of the  Society of Authors . [25]Bookseller World  mentions about 80 \" UK First Editions Books \" by Janet and Allan. Five series comprise more than 40 books, none published by  Kestrel  or  Viking ; 35 singletons include 8 published by Kestrel (a Viking  imprint ) from 1976 to 1983, and 12 published by Viking from 1984 to 1994.

At a young age Cunningham was apprenticed to a stonemason but spent his free time reading, and writing imitations of old Scottish ballads. In 1807 he contributed to Roche's Literary Recreations and in 1809 or therabouts he sent some Scottish Ballads he claimed to have collected to be used in Cromek's \"Remains of Nithdale and Galloway Song. Actually they were his own creations.\" He came to know the author James Hogg and through him met Sir Walter Scott who suspected that the ballads in Cromek's were in fact Cunningham's. \n\nIn 1813 he published, \"Songs, Chiefly in the rural dialect of Scotland.\u201d Thereafter, Cunningham, was persuaded by Cromek to move to London where be became a parliamentary reporter for \"The London Magazine\" and met the sculptor Sir Francis Chantry, later becoming his assistant and secretary. A position he held from 1814 until Chantry's death in 1841. During this time, Cunningham continued to pursue literary interests when time permitted, writing three novels, a series of stories (which he contributed to Blackwood's Magazine,) biographies, as well as many songs. Also during this time he became a part of a circle of writers that included Charles Lamb, Thomas DeQuincey, William Hazlitt and Thomas Hood.\n\nHe married the servant of the house in which he was lodging and had six children, several of whom also became writers.\n\nCunningham's romantic writings sometimes seem to be spoiled by rhetoric and his poetic dramas are little read today but he is best remembered for his poems and ballads.\n\nWorks by Allan Cunningham:\n\nTraditional tales of the English and Scottish Peasantry (1822)\nSongs of Scotland Ancient and Modern (1825)\nLives of The Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1829-33)\nThe Works of Robert Burns (1834)\nLife of Wilkie (1843)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSources: \nLarousse Dictionary of Writers, Editor Rosemary Goring,1994 (page 227) (ISBN:0-7523-0039-3)    Copywright Larousse Plc, 1994\n\nThe Wordsworth Companion to Literature In English edited by Ian Ousby and Margaret Atwood, Copyright: Cambridge University Press, 1992 (also page 227)  (ISBN: 1-85326-336-2)\n\nThe Project Gutenberg E-Book of A Short Biographical Dictionary of English\nLiterature, by John W.

Cunningham's early life was marked by a connection to Robert Burns, as his father was a neighbor of the renowned poet. As a boy, Cunningham even attended Burns' funeral, an experience that likely sparked his own interest in poetry and writing. Growing up in the picturesque Scottish countryside, Cunningham's creative spirit was nurtured from a young age. He spent his free time reading and writing, particularly enjoying the old Scottish ballads that would influence his later work.\n\nAt a young age, Cunningham was apprenticed to a stonemason, a trade he learned and practiced diligently. However, his true passion lay in words and stories. In 1807, he took a bold step towards his literary aspirations by contributing to Roche's Literary Recreations. This was followed by a clever ruse in which he submitted Scottish ballads he had written himself to Cromek's \"Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song,\" claiming them to be collected folk songs. This deception was not without consequence, as Sir Walter Scott, whom he met through the author James Hogg, suspected the true authorship of the ballads.\n\nIn 1813, Cunningham published \"Songs, Chiefly in the Rural Dialect of Scotland,\" a collection that firmly established him as a poet of note. The book's title hints at his affinity for the rural Scottish dialect and his desire to preserve and celebrate it through his writing. Following this success, Cunningham made a significant move to London, where he became a parliamentary reporter for \"The London Magazine.\" This new urban environment provided a stark contrast to his rural upbringing, exposing him to a diverse range of experiences and people.\n\nIn London, Cunningham also formed a close friendship with the sculptor Sir Francis Chantry, becoming his assistant and secretary from 1814 until Chantry's death in 1841. This period was a busy and productive time for Cunningham. He immersed himself in literary pursuits, writing three novels, a series of stories for Blackwood's Magazine, biographies, and numerous songs. He also became part of a vibrant circle of writers that included notable figures such as Charles Lamb, Thomas De Quincey, William Hazlitt, and Thomas Hood. These associations undoubtedly influenced and inspired his own writing.\n\nCunningham's literary output was diverse, and he is remembered for his poems, ballads, and other writings. His works include \"Traditional Tales of the English and Scottish Peasantry\" (1822), \"Songs of Scotland Ancient and Modern\" (1825), and biographies of prominent artists such as \"Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" (1829-1833). He also edited \"The Works of Robert Burns\" in 1834, a tribute to the poet who had indirectly influenced his own literary journey.\n\nWhile Cunningham's romantic writings were sometimes criticized for being overly rhetorical, his ballads and poems have endured. They capture the beauty and spirit of his Scottish heritage, evoking the landscapes and traditions that inspired him. Cunningham's life and work serve as a testament to the power of following one's passions, even in the face of humble beginnings and seemingly unrelated career paths. \n\nAllan Cunningham's legacy is that of a poet who celebrated his cultural roots through his art, leaving behind a rich literary heritage for future generations to enjoy and draw inspiration from. His work continues to be a source of pride for Scotland and a reminder of the enduring appeal of traditional ballads and folk songs.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: read this poet\u2019s poems\nAllen Ginsberg was born in Newark, New Jersey, on June 3, 1926. The son of Louis and Naomi Ginsberg, two Jewish members of the New York literary counterculture of the 1920s, Ginsberg was raised among several progressive political perspectives. A supporter of the Communist party, Ginsberg\u2019s mother was a nudist whose mental health was a concern throughout the poet\u2019s childhood. According to biographer Barry Miles, \u201cNaomi\u2019s illness gave Allen an enormous empathy and tolerance for madness, neurosis, and psychosis.\u201dAs an adolescent, Ginsberg savored\u00a0Walt Whitman, though in 1939, when Ginsberg graduated high school, he considered\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe\u00a0his favorite poet. Eager to follow a childhood hero who had received a scholarship to Columbia University, Ginsberg made a vow that if he got into the school he would devote his life to helping the working class, a cause he took seriously over the course of the next several years.He was admitted to Columbia University, and as a student there in the 1940s, he began close friendships with William S. Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and\u00a0Jack Kerouac, all of whom later became leading figures of the\u00a0Beat movement. The group led Ginsberg to a \u201cNew Vision,\u201d which he defined in his journal: \u201cSince art is merely and ultimately self-expressive, we conclude that the fullest art, the most individual, uninfluenced, unrepressed, uninhibited expression of art is true expression and the true art.\u201dAround this time, Ginsberg also had what he referred to as his \u201cBlake vision,\u201d an auditory hallucination of\u00a0William Blake\u00a0reading his poems \u201cAh! Sunflower,\u201d \u201cThe Sick Rose,\u201d and \u201cLittle Girl Lost.\u201d Ginsberg noted the occurrence several times as a pivotal moment for him in his comprehension of the universe, affecting fundamental beliefs about his life and his work. While Ginsberg claimed that no drugs were involved, he later stated that he used various drugs in an attempt to recapture the feelings inspired by the vision.In 1954, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco. His mentor,\u00a0William Carlos Williams, introduced him to key figures in the San Francisco poetry scene, including\u00a0Kenneth Rexroth. He also met\u00a0Michael McClure, who handed off the duties of curating a reading for the newly established \u201c6\u201d Gallery. With the help of Rexroth, the result was \u201cThe \u20186\u2019 Gallery Reading\u201d which took place on October 7, 1955. The event has been hailed as the birth of the Beat Generation, in no small part because it was also the first public reading of Ginsberg\u2019s \u201cHowl,\u201d a poem that garnered worldwide attention for him and the poets he associated with.In response to Ginsberg\u2019s reading, McClure wrote: \u201cGinsberg read on to the end of the poem, which left us standing in wonder, or cheering and wondering, but knowing at the deepest level that a barrier had been broken, that a human voice and body had been hurled against the harsh wall of America.\u201dShortly after\u00a0Howl and Other Poems\u00a0was published in 1956 by\u00a0City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The work overcame censorship trials, however, and \u201cHowl\u201d\u00a0became one of the most widely read poems of the century, translated into more than twenty-two languages.In the 1960s and 1970s, Ginsberg studied under gurus and Zen masters. As the leading icon of the Beats, Ginsberg was involved in countless political activities, including protests against the Vietnam War, and he spoke openly about issues that concerned him, such as free speech and gay rights agendas.Ginsberg went on to publish numerous collections of poetry, including\u00a0Kaddish and Other Poems\u00a0(City Lights, 1961),\u00a0Planet News: Poems, 1961\u20131967\u00a0(City Lights, 1968), and\u00a0The Fall of America: Poems of These States\u00a0(City Lights, 1973), which won the National Book Award.In 1979, Ginsberg received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 1993, he received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres (the Order of Arts and Letters) from the French minister of culture. He also cofounded and directed the\u00a0Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics\u00a0at the Naropa Institute in Colorado. In his later years, Ginsberg became a distinguished professor at Brooklyn College.On April 5, 1997, in New York City, he died of complications from hepatitis.Andrea Gibson was the first winner of the Women of the World Poetry Slam in 2008.\u00a0Born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1905, Kenneth Rexroth is the author of several collections of poetry and became known as the \"father of the Beats.\"Q.

S. Eliot captured the anxiety of the 1920s in The Waste Land. Ginsberg's bardic rage against material values, however, was in a voice very different from Eliot's scholarly mourning for the loss of the spirit. In his second major work, '\\Kaddish\\' (1961), a poem on the anniversary of his mother's death, Ginsberg described their anguished relationship. \n\nIn the 1960s, while vigorously participating in the anti-Vietnam War movement, he published several poetic works, including '\\Reality Sandwiches\\' (1963) and '\\Planet News\\' (1969). \n\n'\\The Fall of America\\' received the National Book Award for 1974. '\\Collected Poems\\', 1947-85 (1995) contains all of his important work; '\\White Shroud\\' (1987) includes poems from the 1980s. \n\nGinsberg sees himself as a part of the prophetic tradition in poetry begun by William Blake and continued by Walt Whitman. He names his contemporary influences as William Carlos Williams and his friend Jack Kerouac.\n\nPassed away in 1997., Allen Ginsberg was an acclaimed poet and a leading figure of the Beat Generation whose radical literary works and advocacy for social change left an indelible mark on American counterculture. Ginsberg first came to public attention in 1956 with the publication of Howl and Other Poems (City Lights Books).\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Howl,&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;Howl for Carl Solomon,&rdquo; is a long-lined poem in the tradition of Walt Whitman and an outcry of rage and despair against a destructive, abusive society. The poem&rsquo;s raw, honest language and its &ldquo;Hebraic-Melvillian bardic breath,&rdquo; as Ginsberg called it, stunned many traditional critics. James L. Dickey, for instance, referred to &ldquo;Howl&rdquo; as &ldquo;a whipped-up state of excitement&rdquo; and concluded that &ldquo;it takes more than this to make poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOther critics responded to &ldquo;Howl&rdquo; more positively. Richard Eberhart, for example, called &ldquo;Howl&rdquo; &ldquo;a powerful work, cutting through to dynamic meaning&hellip;It is a howl against everything in our mechanistic civilization which kills the spirit&hellip;Its positive force and energy come from a redemptive quality of love.&rdquo; Appraising the impact of &ldquo;Howl,&rdquo; Paul Zweig noted that it &ldquo;almost singlehandedly dislocated the traditionalist poetry of the 1950s.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1957, customs officials seized 520 copies of Howl that were being imported from England by claiming that the book was obscene. In June, Shig Murao, the City Lights bookstore manager, was arrested and jailed for selling Howl to an undercover San Francisco police officer. Poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti was subsequently arrested for publishing the book.The ensuing trial attracted national attention, as prominent literary figures such as Mark Schorer, Kenneth Rexroth, and Walter Van Tilburg Clark spoke in defense of Howl. Schorer testified that &ldquo;Ginsberg uses the rhythms of ordinary speech and also the diction of ordinary speech. I would say the poem uses necessarily the language of vulgarity.&rdquo; Clark called Howl &ldquo;the work of a thoroughly honest poet, who is also a highly competent technician.&rdquo; The testimony eventually persuaded Judge Clayton W. Horn to rule that Howl was not obscene. The qualities cited in its defense helped make Howl the manifesto of the Beat Movement and pave the way for other challenging works to be published.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGinsberg went on to publish many books after Howl, including Kaddish and Other Poems (City Lights, 1961), Planet News: 1961&ndash;1967 (City Lights, 1968), and The Fall of America: Poems of These States, 1965&ndash;1971 (City Lights, 1973), which won the National Book Award.\r\n\r\nOften, Ginsberg&rsquo;s poems contain references to his early childhood and young adulthood. Born in Newark, New Jersey, to a Jewish family, he grew up in nearby Paterson. Both of his parents, Louis and Naomi Ginsberg, were members of the New York literary counterculture of the 1920s. Louis was a schoolteacher and a published poet. Naomi was a supporter of the communist party and would bring her sons along with her to party meetings. She had a mental illness and was in and out of mental hospitals throughout Ginsberg&rsquo;s childhood and adulthood. In Allen Ginsberg: A Biography (Virgin Books, 2000), Barry Miles observed, &ldquo;Naomi&rsquo;s illness gave Allen an enormous empathy and tolerance for madness, neurosis, and psychosis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kaddish,&rdquo; a poem similar in style and form to &ldquo;Howl,&rdquo; is based on the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead and tells the life story of Ginsberg&rsquo;s mother, Naomi. The poet&rsquo;s complex feelings for his mother, colored by her struggle with mental illness, are at the heart of this long-lined poem. It is considered to be one of Ginsberg&rsquo;s finest: Thomas F. Merrill called it &ldquo;Ginsberg at his purest and perhaps at his best&rdquo;; Louis Simpson referred to it as &ldquo;a masterpiece.&rdquo; Ginsberg&rsquo;s experiences with his mother&rsquo;s mental illness and institutionalization are also frequently referred to in &ldquo;Howl.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn 1943, while studying at Columbia University, Ginsberg befriended William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. The trio later established themselves as pivotal figures in the Beat Movement. Known for their unconventional views and frequently rambunctious behavior, Ginsberg and his friends also experimented with drugs. On one occasion, Ginsberg used his college dorm room to store stolen goods acquired by an acquaintance. When faced with prosecution, Ginsberg took a plea deal and subsequently spent several months in a mental institution. It was in a waiting room of the New York State Psychiatric Institute that Ginsberg first met the writer Carl Solomon, to whom Ginsberg would later dedicate his poem &ldquo;Howl.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Ginsberg remained in New York City and worked various jobs, took part in public readings at St. Mark&rsquo;s Church in-the-Bowery, and met Gregory Corso, who became a lifelong friend. In 1954, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco, where the Beat Movement was developing through the activities of such poets as Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. That same year, he met the poet Peter Orlovsky. They fell in love and were lifelong partners. Selections from their correspondence have been published in several books, including The Letters of Allen Ginsberg (Da Capo Press, 2008), Straight Hearts&rsquo; Delight (Gay Sunshine Press, 1980), and the anthology My Dear Boy: Gay Love Letters through the Centuries (Leyland Publications, 1998).&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s early poems were greatly influenced by fellow New Jersey residents Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg recalled being taught at school that Williams &ldquo;was some kind of awkward crude provincial from New Jersey,&rdquo; but upon talking to Williams about his poetry, Ginsberg&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nsuddenly realized [that Williams] was hearing with raw ears. The sound, pure sound and rhythm&mdash;as it was spoken around him, and he was trying to adapt his poetry rhythms out of the actual talk-rhythms he heard rather than metronome or sing-song archaic literary rhythms.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother major influence was Ginsberg&rsquo;s friend Kerouac, who wrote novels in a &ldquo;spontaneous prose&rdquo; style that Ginsberg admired and adapted in his own work. Ginsberg began writing a poem not, as he states, &ldquo;by working on it in little pieces and fragments from different times, but remembering an idea in my head and writing it down on the spot and completing it there.&rdquo; Both Williams and Kerouac emphasized a writer&rsquo;s emotions and natural mode of expression over traditional literary structures.\r\n\r\nA major theme in Ginsberg&rsquo;s life and poetry was politics. Kenneth Rexroth called this aspect of Ginsberg&rsquo;s work &ldquo;an almost perfect fulfillment of the long, Whitman, Populist, social revolutionary tradition in American poetry.&rdquo; In a number of poems, Ginsberg refers to the union struggles of the 1930s, popular radical figures, and the McCarthy red hunts. In &ldquo;Wichita Vortex Sutra,&rdquo; he attempts to end the Vietnam War through a kind of magical, poetic evocation. In &ldquo;Plutonian Ode,&rdquo; he attempts a similar feat: ending the dangers of nuclear power through the magic of a poet&rsquo;s breath.\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s political activities echoed his poetic preference for individual expression over traditional structure. In the mid-1960s, he was closely associated with the counterculture and antiwar movements. He created and advocated &ldquo;flower power,&rdquo; a strategy in which antiwar demonstrators promoted positive values like peace and love to dramatize their opposition to the death and destruction caused by the Vietnam War. The use of flowers, bells, smiles, and mantras (sacred chants) became common among demonstrators.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn 1967, Ginsberg was an organizer of the &ldquo;Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In,&rdquo; an event modeled after the Hindu mela, a religious festival. It was the first of the countercultural festivals and served as an inspiration for hundreds of others. In 1969, when antiwar activists staged an &ldquo;exorcism of the Pentagon,&rdquo; Ginsberg composed the mantra they chanted. He testified for the defense in the Chicago Seven Conspiracy Trial, in which antiwar activists were charged with conspiracy to cross state lines to promote a riot. Ginsberg was arrested at an antidraft, antiwar demonstration in New York City in 1967 and tear-gassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. In 1972, he was jailed for demonstrating against then-President Richard Nixon at the Republican National Convention in Miami. In 1978, he and Peter Orlovsky were arrested for sitting on train tracks in order to stop a trainload of radioactive waste coming from the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant in Colorado.\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s activism caused him problems in other countries as well. In 1965, he visited Cuba as a correspondent for Evergreen Review. After he complained about the treatment of gay people at the University of Havana, the government asked Ginsberg to leave the country. In the same year, Ginsberg traveled to Czechoslovakia, where he was elected &ldquo;King of May&rdquo; by thousands of students in Prague. The next day the Czech government requested that he leave. Ginsberg attributes his expulsion to the Czech secret police being embarrassed by the acclaim given to &ldquo;a bearded American fairy dope poet.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAnother continuing concern reflected in Ginsberg&rsquo;s poetry was a focus on the spiritual and visionary. His interest in these matters was inspired by a series of visions he had while reading William Blake&rsquo;s poetry. Ginsberg recalled hearing &ldquo;a very deep earthen grave voice in the room, which I immediately assumed, I didn&rsquo;t think twice, was Blake&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;the peculiar quality of the voice was something unforgettable because it was like God had a human voice, with all the infinite tenderness and anciency and mortal gravity of a living Creator speaking to his son.&rdquo; Such visions prompted an interest in mysticism that led Ginsberg to experiment, for a time, with various drugs. He claimed that some of his best poetry was written under the influence of drugs: the second part of &ldquo;Howl&rdquo; with peyote, &ldquo;Kaddish&rdquo; with amphetamines, and &ldquo;Wales&mdash;A Visitation&rdquo; with LSD.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter a journey to India in 1962, however, during which he was introduced to meditation and yoga, Ginsberg changed his attitude toward drugs. He became convinced that meditation and yoga were far superior in raising one&rsquo;s consciousness, while he maintained that psychedelics could prove helpful in writing poetry. Psychedelics, he said, are &ldquo;a variant of yoga and [the] exploration of consciousness.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s study of Eastern religions was spurred on by his discovery of mantras, which are rhythmic chants used for spiritual effects. Their use of rhythm, breath, and elemental sounds seemed to him a kind of poetry. He incorporated mantras into the body of poems, which transformed the work into a kind of poetic prayer. During poetry readings, he often began by chanting a mantra in order to set the proper mood. His interest in Eastern religions eventually led him to the Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa, Rinpoche, a Buddhist abbot from Tibet who strongly influenced Ginsberg&rsquo;s writing. The early 1970s found the poet taking classes at Trungpa&rsquo;s Naropa Institute in Colorado as well as teaching poetry classes there. In 1972, Ginsberg took the Refuge and Boddhisattva vows, formally committing himself to the Buddhist faith.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, Ginsberg and Anne Waldman, with John Cage and Diane di Prima, co-founded the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics as a branch of Trungpa&rsquo;s Naropa Institute. Ginsberg attracted such prominent writers as Ron Padgett and William S. Burroughs to speak and teach at the school.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his rise to influence and his staying power as a figure in American art and culture, Ginsberg&rsquo;s work was the object of much scholarly attention throughout his lifetime. A documentary directed by Jerry Aronson, The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg, was released in 1994. The same year, Stanford University paid Ginsberg a reported one million dollars for his personal archives. Ginsberg, however, remained a controversial figure throughout his life. An alumni group pressured Stanford University to withdraw their offer by citing Ginsberg&rsquo;s involvement with NAMBLA (the North American Man/Boy Love Association), though Ginsberg said he joined the organization in order to defend free speech. Ginsberg&rsquo;s involvement with NAMBLA also cost him a teaching position at his alma mater, Columbia University.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1997, while already plagued with diabetes and chronic hepatitis, Ginsberg was diagnosed with liver cancer. After learning of this illness, Ginsberg promptly produced twelve brief poems. The next day he suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma. Two days later, he died. In the New York Times, Ginsberg was remembered by William Burroughs as &ldquo;a great person with worldwide influence.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s poetry from the last few years of his life was collected in Death &amp; Fame: Poems, 1993&ndash;1997 (Harper Perennial, 2000). This volume includes works produced by Ginsberg immediately after he learned of his cancer. A Publishers Weekly reviewer, who acknowledged that &ldquo;there has never been an American poet as public as Ginsberg,&rdquo; described Death and Fame as &ldquo;a perfect capstone to a noble life.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother of Ginsberg&rsquo;s posthumous publications, Deliberate Prose: Selected Essays, 1952&ndash;1995 (Harper Collins, 2000), presents more than 150 essays on such subjects as nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War, censorship, poets including Walt Whitman and Gregory Corso, and other cultural luminaries, including musician John Lennon and photographer Robert Frank. A Publishers Weekly critic appraised Deliberate Prose as &ldquo;sometimes lovely, sometimes slapdash&rdquo; and added that the book is &ldquo;sure to appeal to [Ginsberg&rsquo;s] broad contingent of fans.&rdquo; Booklist reviewer Ray Olson, meanwhile, found Ginsberg&rsquo;s essays &ldquo;more immediately approachable than much of his verse.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGinsberg&rsquo;s letters, journals, and even his photographs of fellow Beats continue to provide critics and scholars with new insights into his life and work. &ldquo;Like it or not, no voice better echoes his times than Mr. Ginsberg&rsquo;s,&rdquo; concluded a reviewer in The Economist. &ldquo;He was a bridge between the literary avant-garde and pop culture.&rdquo;, Irwin Allen Ginsberg  ( / \u02c8 \u0261 \u026a n z b \u025c\u02d0r \u0261 / ; June 3, 1926 \u2013 April 5, 1997) was an American poet and writer. As a student at  Columbia University  in the 1940s, he began friendships with  Lucien Carr ,  William S. Burroughs  and  Jack Kerouac , forming the core of the  Beat Generation . He vigorously opposed  militarism ,  economic materialism , and  sexual repression , and he embodied various aspects of this  counterculture  with his views on drugs, sex,  multiculturalism , hostility to  bureaucracy , and openness to  Eastern religions . [1] [2]Best known for his poem \" Howl \", Ginsberg denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of  capitalism  and  conformity  in the United States. [3] [4]  San Francisco police and US Customs seized copies of \"Howl\" in 1956, and a subsequent obscenity trial in 1957 attracted widespread publicity due to the poem's language and descriptions of heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when  sodomy laws  made (male) homosexual acts a crime in every state. [5] [6]  The poem reflected Ginsberg's own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including  Peter Orlovsky , his lifelong partner. [7]  Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that \"Howl\" was not obscene, asking: \"Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?\" [8]Ginsberg was a  Buddhist  who extensively studied  Eastern religious disciplines . He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in apartments in New York City's  East Village . [9]  One of his most influential teachers was Tibetan Buddhist  Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa , the founder of the  Naropa Institute  in  Boulder, Colorado . [10]  At Trungpa's urging, Ginsberg and poet  Anne Waldman  started  The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics  there in 1974. [11]For decades, Ginsberg was active in political protests across a range of issues from the  Vietnam War  to the  war on drugs . [12]  His poem \" September on Jessore Road \" drew attention to refugees fleeing the  1971 Bangladeshi genocide , exemplifying what literary critic  Helen Vendler  described as Ginsberg's persistent opposition to \"imperial politics\" and the \"persecution of the powerless\". [13]  His collection  The Fall of America  shared the annual  National Book Award for Poetry  in 1974. [14]  In 1979, he received the  National Arts Club  gold medal and was inducted into the  American Academy of Arts and Letters . [15]  He was a  Pulitzer Prize  finalist in 1995 for his book  Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986\u20131992 . [16]Ginsberg was born into a Jewish [17]  family in  Newark, New Jersey , and grew up in nearby  Paterson . [18]  He was the second son of  Louis Ginsberg , also born in Newark, a schoolteacher and published poet, and the former Naomi Levy, born in  Nevel  (Russia) and a fervent  Marxist . [19]As a teenager, Ginsberg began to write letters to  The New York Times  about political issues, such as  World War II  and  workers' rights . [20]  He published his first poems in the  Paterson Morning Call . [21]  While in high school, Ginsberg became interested in the works of  Walt Whitman , inspired by his teacher's passionate reading. [22]  In 1943, Ginsberg graduated from  Eastside High School  and briefly attended  Montclair State College  before entering  Columbia University  on a scholarship from the  Young Men's Hebrew Association  of Paterson. [19]In 1945, he joined the  Merchant Marine  to earn money to continue his education at Columbia. [23]  While at Columbia, Ginsberg contributed to the  Columbia Review  literary journal, the  Jester  humor magazine, won the Woodberry Poetry Prize, served as president of the  Philolexian Society  (literary and debate group), and joined  Boar's Head Society  (poetry society). [24] [25] \nHe was a resident of  Hartley Hall , where other Beat Generation poets such as  Jack Kerouac  and  Herbert Gold  also lived. [26] [27]  Ginsberg has stated that he considered his required freshman seminar in Great Books, taught by  Lionel Trilling , to be his favorite Columbia course. [28]According to The Poetry Foundation, Ginsberg spent several months in a mental institution after he pleaded insanity during a hearing. He was allegedly being prosecuted for harboring stolen goods in his dorm room. It was noted that the stolen property was not his, but belonged to an acquaintance. [29]  Ginsberg also took part in public readings at the Episcopal  St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery  which would later hold a memorial service for him after his death. [30] [31]Ginsberg referred to his parents in a 1985 interview as \"old-fashioned delicatessen philosophers\". [18]  His mother was also an active member of the  Communist Party  and took Ginsberg and his brother Eugene to party meetings. Ginsberg later said that his mother \"made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.'\" [20]  Of his father Ginsberg said: \"My father would go around the house either reciting  Emily Dickinson  and  Longfellow  under his breath or attacking  T. S. Eliot  for ruining poetry with his ' obscurantism .' I grew suspicious of both sides.\" [18]Naomi Ginsberg had  schizophrenia  which often manifested as  paranoid   delusions ,  disordered thinking  and multiple  suicide attempts . [32]  She would claim, for example, that the president had implanted listening devices in their home and that her mother-in-law was trying to kill her. [33] [34]  Her suspicion of those around her caused Naomi to draw closer to young Allen, \"her little pet,\" as Bill Morgan says in his biography of Ginsberg, titled  I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg . [35]  She also tried to kill herself by slitting her wrists and was soon taken to  Greystone , a mental hospital; she would spend much of Ginsberg's youth in mental hospitals. [36] [37]  His experiences with his mother and her mental illness were a major inspiration for his two major works, \" Howl \" and his long autobiographical poem \" Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894\u20131956) \". [38]When he was in junior high school, he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist. The trip deeply disturbed Ginsberg\u2014he mentioned it and other moments from his childhood in \"Kaddish\". [39]  His experiences with his mother's mental illness and her institutionalization are also frequently referred to in \"Howl.\" For example, \"Pilgrim State, Rockland, and Grey Stone's foetid halls\" is a reference to institutions frequented by his mother and  Carl Solomon , ostensibly the subject of the poem: Pilgrim State Hospital and  Rockland State Hospital  in New York and  Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital  in  New Jersey . [40] [41] [42]  This is followed soon by the line \"with mother finally ******.\" Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive \"fucked.\" [41]  He also says of Solomon in section three, \"I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,\" once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother. [43]Ginsberg received a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of \"Howl\" he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, \"The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window\u2014I have the key\u2014Get married Allen don't take drugs\u2014the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window.\" [44]  In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, \"God's informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.\" [45]  These letters and the absence of a facility to recite  kaddish  inspired Ginsberg to write \"Kaddish\", which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines \"the key is in the light\" and \"the key is in the window.\" [46]In Ginsberg's first year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate  Lucien Carr , who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including  Jack Kerouac ,  William S. Burroughs , and  John Clellon Holmes . They bonded, because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of post\u2013World War II,  McCarthy -era America. [47]  Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Yeats' \"A Vision\"), for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to  Neal Cassady , for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. [48]  In the first chapter of his 1957 novel  On the Road  Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. [39]  Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg's association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in  On the Road . This was a source of strain in their relationship. [49]Also, in New York, Ginsberg met  Gregory Corso  in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understood homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso's poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg's girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. [50]Shortly after this period in Ginsberg's life, he became romantically involved with  Elise Nada Cowen  after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at  Barnard College  whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation's period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of  Ezra Pound  and  T. S. Eliot , when she met  Joyce Johnson  and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and  Come and Join the Dance , which expressed the two women's experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend,  Carl Solomon , to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl.\" This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.In 1948, in an apartment in  East Harlem , Ginsberg experienced an  auditory hallucination  while masturbating and reading the poetry of  William Blake , [51]  which he later referred to as his \"Blake vision\". Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God\u2014also described as the \"voice of the  Ancient of Days \"\u2014or of Blake himself reading \" Ah! Sun-flower \", \" The Sick Rose \" and \" The Little Girl Lost \". The experience lasted several days, with him believing that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe; Ginsberg recounted that after looking at latticework on the  fire escape  of the apartment and then at the sky, he intuited that one had been crafted by human beings, while the other had been crafted by itself. [52]  He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture the feeling of interconnectedness later with various drugs. [53]Ginsberg moved to  San Francisco  during the 1950s. Before  Howl and Other Poems  was published in 1956 by  City Lights , he worked as a market researcher. [54]In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met  Peter Orlovsky  (1933\u20132010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner. [55]  Selections from their  correspondence  have been published. [56]Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the  San Francisco Renaissance  (James Broughton, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason and Kenneth Rexroth) and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg's mentor  William Carlos Williams  wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead  Kenneth Rexroth , who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and  Zen  enthusiasts who had become friends at  Reed College :  Gary Snyder ,  Philip Whalen , and  Lew Welch . In 1959, along with poets John Kelly,  Bob Kaufman ,  A. D. Winans , and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the  Beatitude  poetry magazine.Wally Hedrick \u2014a painter and co-founder of the  Six Gallery \u2014approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the  Six Gallery . At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl,\" he changed his \"fucking mind,\" as he put it. [57]  Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery.\" One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The  Six Gallery reading \" took place on October 7, 1955. [58]  The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the  Beat Generation . Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl,\" a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac's novel  The Dharma Bums , describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.Ginsberg's principal work, \"Howl,\" is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked [...].\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco's  City Lights Bookstore , it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a  cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre  among defenders of the  First Amendment , and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. [59]  Ginsberg and  Shig Murao , the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends. [60]Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's  Duluoz Legend ). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg's experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though  \"Kaddish\"  deals more explicitly with his mother, \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsberg's life. He begins the poem with \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness\", which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. [61]  This madness was the \"angry fix\" that society needed to function\u2014madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on \"Carl Solomon! I'm with you in Rockland\", and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his \"straightjacket\". Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl,\" his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start. [ citation needed ]In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in  Morocco , he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9  rue G\u00eet-le-C\u0153ur  that was to become known as the  Beat Hotel . They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg began his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed  Bomb  and  Marriage , and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together  Naked Lunch  from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer  Harold Chapman , who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962\u20131963, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in  Calcutta  (now Kolkata) and  Benares  (Varanasi). On his road to India he stayed two months in Athens ( August 29, 1961 \u2013 October 31, 1961) where he visited various cites such as  Delphi ,  Mycines ,  Crete , and then he continued his journey to  Israel ,  Kenya  and finally  India . [62]  Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young  Bengali  poets of the time including  Shakti Chattopadhyay  and  Sunil Gangopadhyay . Ginsberg had several political connections in India; most notably  Pupul Jayakar  who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him.In May 1965, Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free. [63]  Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at  Better Books , which was described by  Jeff Nuttall  as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind.\" [63]   Tom McGrath  wrote: \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England\u2014or at least in the history of English Poetry.\" [64]Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the  International Poetry Incarnation , [64]  which was held at the  Royal Albert Hall  in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg,  Adrian Mitchell ,  Alexander Trocchi ,  Harry Fainlight ,  Anselm Hollo ,  Christopher Logue ,  George MacBeth , Gregory Corso,  Lawrence Ferlinghetti ,  Michael Horovitz ,  Simon Vinkenoog ,  Spike Hawkins  and  Tom McGrath . The event was organized by Ginsberg's friend, the filmmaker  Barbara Rubin . [65] [66]Peter Whitehead  documented the event on film and released it as  Wholly Communion . A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.Though the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \" Beat Generation .\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include:  David Amram ,  Bob Kaufman ;  Diane di Prima ;  Jim Cohn ; poets associated with the  Black Mountain College  such as  Charles Olson ,  Robert Creeley , and  Denise Levertov ; poets associated with the  New York School  such as  Frank O'Hara  and  Kenneth Koch . LeRoi Jones before he became  Amiri Baraka , who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper. Baraka's independent publishing house Totem Press published Ginsberg's early work. [67]  Through a party organized by Baraka, Ginsberg was introduced to  Langston Hughes  while  Ornette Coleman  played saxophone. [68]Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the  beat movement  of the 1950s and the  hippies  of the 1960s, befriending, among others,  Timothy Leary ,  Ken Kesey ,  Hunter S. Thompson , and  Bob Dylan . Ginsberg gave his last public reading at  Booksmith , a bookstore in the  Haight-Ashbury  neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death. [69]  In 1993, Ginsberg visited the  University of Maine at Orono  to pay homage to the 90-year-old great  Carl Rakosi . [70]In 1950, Kerouac began studying Buddhism [71]  and shared what he learned from  Dwight Goddard's   Buddhist Bible  with Ginsberg. [71]  Ginsberg first heard about the  Four Noble Truths  and such sutras as the  Diamond Sutra  at this time. [71]Ginsberg's spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India with  Gary Snyder . [71]  Snyder had previously spent time in  Kyoto  to study at the First Zen Institute at  Daitoku-ji  Monastery. [71]  At one point, Snyder chanted the  Prajnaparamita , which in Ginsberg's words \"blew my mind.\" [71]  His interest piqued, Ginsberg traveled to meet  the Dalai Lama  as well as the  Karmapa  at Rumtek Monastery. [71]  Continuing on his journey, Ginsberg met  Dudjom Rinpoche  in  Kalimpong , who taught him: \"If you see something horrible, don't cling to it, and if you see something beautiful, don't cling to it.\" [71]After returning to the United States, a chance encounter on a New York City street with  Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa   Rinpoche  (they both tried to catch the same cab), [72]  a  Kagyu  and  Nyingma   Tibetan Buddhist  master, led to Trungpa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher. [71]  Ginsberg helped Trungpa and New York poet  Anne Waldman  in founding the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at  Naropa University  in  Boulder, Colorado .Ginsberg was also involved with  Krishnaism . He had started incorporating chanting the  Hare Krishna mantra  into his religious practice in the mid-1960s. After learning that  A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , the founder of the  Hare Krishna  movement in the Western world had rented a store front in New York, he befriended him, visiting him often and suggesting publishers for his books, and a fruitful relationship began. This relationship is documented by  Satsvarupa dasa Goswami  in his biographical account  Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta . Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause. [73]Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's  required prohibitions , Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy [74]  and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. [75]  He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic  swami  from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other  counterculture  ideologists like  Timothy Leary ,  Gary Snyder , and  Alan Watts , Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community. [74] [76] [nb 1]On January 17, 1967, Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at  San Francisco International Airport , where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands. [77] [nb 2]  To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami's message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the  Mantra-Rock Dance , a musical event 1967 held at the  Avalon Ballroom  by the San Francisco  Hare Krishna  temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time:  Big Brother and the Holding Company  with  Janis Joplin , the  Grateful Dead , and  Moby Grape , who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder  Bhaktivedanta Swami  and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the  Hare Krishna mantra . [78] [79] [80]Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg's live delivery during poetry readings. [81]  He often accompanied himself on a  harmonium , and was often accompanied by a guitarist. It is believed that the Hindi and Buddhist poet  Nagarjun  had introduced Ginsberg to the harmonium in Banaras. According to  Malay Roy Choudhury , Ginsberg refined his practice while learning from his relatives, including his cousin Savitri Banerjee. [82]  When Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Lord  Krishna  on  William F. Buckley, Jr. 's TV show  Firing Line  on September 3, 1968, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted slowly as he played dolefully on a harmonium. According to  Richard Brookhiser , an associate of Buckley's, the host commented that it was \"the most unharried Krishna I've ever heard.\" [83]At the 1967  Human Be-In  in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and the 1970 Black Panther rally at Yale campus Allen chanted \"Om\" repeatedly over a sound system for hours on end. [84]Ginsberg further brought mantras into the world of rock and roll when he recited the  Heart Sutra  in the song \" Ghetto Defendant .\" The song appears on the 1982 album  Combat Rock  by British first wave punk band  The Clash .Ginsberg came in touch with the  Hungryalist  poets of  Bengal , especially Malay Roy Choudhury, who introduced Ginsberg to the three fish with one head of Indian emperor  Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar . The three fish symbolised coexistence of all thought, philosophy, and religion. [85]In spite of Ginsberg's attraction to Eastern religions, the journalist  Jane Kramer  argues that he, like Whitman, adhered to an \"American brand of mysticism\" that was \"rooted in humanism and in a romantic and visionary ideal of harmony among men.\" [86]The Allen Ginsberg Estate and Jewel Heart International partnered to present \"Transforming Minds: Kyabje Gelek Rimpoche and Friends\", a gallery and online exhibition of images of  Gelek Rimpoche  by Allen Ginsberg, a student with whom he had an \"indissoluble bond,\" in 2021 at  Tibet House US  in New York City. [87] [88]  Fifty negatives from Ginsberg's Stanford University photo archive celebrated \"the unique relationship between Allen and Rimpoche.\" The selection of never-before presented images, featuring great Tibetan masters including the Dalai Lama, Tibetologists, and students were \"guided by Allen's extensive notes on the contact sheets and images he'd circled with the intention to print.\" [89]In 1960, he was treated for a  tropical disease , and it is speculated that he contracted  hepatitis  from an unsterilized needle administered by a doctor, which played a role in his death 37 years later. [90]Ginsberg was a lifelong smoker, and though he tried to quit for health and religious reasons, his busy schedule in later life made it difficult, and he always returned to smoking.In the 1970s, Ginsberg had two minor strokes which were first diagnosed as  Bell's palsy , which gave him significant paralysis and stroke-like drooping of the muscles in one side of his face. Later in life, he also had constant minor ailments such as  high blood pressure . Many of these symptoms were related to stress, but he never slowed down his schedule. [91]Ginsberg won a 1974  National Book Award  for  The Fall of America  (split with  Adrienne Rich ,  Diving into the Wreck ). [14]In 1986, Ginsberg was awarded the Golden Wreath by the  Struga Poetry Evenings  International Festival in Macedonia, the second American poet to be so awarded since  W. H. Auden . At Struga, Ginsberg met with the other Golden Wreath winners,  Bulat Okudzhava  and  Andrei Voznesensky .In 1989, Ginsberg appeared in  Rosa von Praunheim 's award-winning film  Silence = Death  about the fight of gay artists in New York City for AIDS-education and the rights of HIV infected people. [92]In 1993, the French Minister of Culture appointed Ginsberg a  Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres .Ginsberg continued to help his friends as much as he could: he gave money to  Herbert Huncke  out of his own pocket, regularly supplied neighbor  Arthur Russell  with an extension cord to power his home recording setup, [93] [94]  and housed a broke, drug-addicted  Harry Smith .With the exception of a special guest appearance at the  NYU  Poetry  Slam  on February 20, 1997, Ginsberg gave what is thought to be his last reading at The  Booksmith  in San Francisco on December 16, 1996.After returning home from the hospital for the last time, where he had been unsuccessfully treated for  congestive heart failure , Ginsberg continued making phone calls to say goodbye to nearly everyone in his address book. Some of the phone calls were sad and interrupted by crying, and others were joyous and optimistic. [95]  Ginsberg continued to write through his final illness, with his last poem, \"Things I'll Not Do (Nostalgias)\", written on March 30. [96]He died on April 5, 1997, surrounded by family and friends in his  East Village  loft in Manhattan, succumbing to  liver cancer  via complications of  hepatitis  at the age of 70. [19]   Gregory Corso ,  Roy Lichtenstein ,  Patti Smith  and others came by to pay their respects. [97]  He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in his family plot in Gomel Chesed Cemetery in Newark. [98]  He was survived by Orlovsky.In 1998, various writers, including  Catfish McDaris  read at a gathering at Ginsberg's farm to honor Allen and the Beats. [99]Good Will Hunting  (released in December 1997) was dedicated to Ginsberg, as well as Burroughs, who died four months later. [100]Ginsberg's willingness to talk about taboo subjects made him a controversial figure during the conservative 1950s, and a significant figure in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing  Howl . At the time, such \"sex talk\" employed in  Howl  was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography, and could be prosecuted under law. [101]  Ginsberg used phrases such as \"cocksucker\", \"fucked in the ass\", and \"cunt\" as part of the poem's depiction of different aspects of American culture. Numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time, including  Lady Chatterley's Lover . [102]  The sex that Ginsberg described did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples, or even longtime lovers. Instead, Ginsberg portrayed  casual sex . [103]  For example, in  Howl , Ginsberg praises the man \"who sweetened the snatches of a million girls.\" Ginsberg used gritty descriptions and explicit sexual language, pointing out the man \"who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup.\" In his poetry, Ginsberg also discussed the then-taboo topic of homosexuality. The explicit sexual language that filled  Howl  eventually led to an important trial on  First Amendment  issues. Ginsberg's publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography, and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges, because the poem carried \"redeeming social importance,\" [104]  thus setting an important legal precedent. Ginsberg continued to broach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 1970 to 1996, Ginsberg had a long-term affiliation with  PEN American Center  with efforts to defend free expression. When explaining how he approached controversial topics, he often pointed to  Herbert Huncke : he said that when he first got to know Huncke in the 1940s, Ginsberg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction, but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Huncke was left with nowhere to go for help. [105]Ginsberg was a signer of the  anti-war  manifesto \"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority\", circulated among draft resistors in 1967 by members of the radical intellectual collective  RESIST . Other signers and RESIST members included  Mitchell Goodman ,  Henry Braun ,  Denise Levertov ,  Noam Chomsky ,  William Sloane Coffin ,  Dwight Macdonald ,  Robert Lowell , and  Norman Mailer . [106] [107]  In 1968, Ginsberg signed the \" Writers and Editors War Tax Protest \" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the  Vietnam War , [108]  and later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated  tax resistance  as a form of anti-war protest. [109]He was present the night of the  Tompkins Square Park riot (1988)  and provided an eyewitness account to  The New York Times . [110]Ginsberg talked openly about his connections with communism and his admiration for past communist heroes and the labor movement at a time when the  Red Scare  and  McCarthyism  were still raging. He admired  Fidel Castro  and many other Marxist figures from the 20th century. [111] [112]  In \" America \" (1956), Ginsberg writes: \"America, I used to be a communist when I was a kid I'm not sorry\". Biographer  Jonah Raskin  has claimed that, despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy, Ginsberg held \"his own  idiosyncratic  version of communism.\" [113]  On the other hand, when  Donald Manes , a New York City politician, publicly accused Ginsberg of being a member of the  Communist Party , Ginsberg objected: \"I am not, as a matter of fact, a member of the Communist party, nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government or any government by violence ... I must say that I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capitalist that I have observed\". [114]Ginsberg travelled to several communist countries to promote free speech. He claimed that communist countries, such as China, welcomed him because they thought he was an enemy of capitalism, but often turned against him when they saw him as a troublemaker. For example, in 1965 Ginsberg was deported from  Cuba  for publicly protesting the persecution of homosexuals. [115]  The Cubans sent him to  Czechoslovakia , where one week after being named the  Kr\u00e1l maj\u00e1lesu  (\"King of May\", [116]  a students' festivity, celebrating spring and student life), Ginsberg was arrested for alleged drug use and public drunkenness, and the security agency  StB  confiscated several of his writings, which they considered to be lewd and morally dangerous. Ginsberg was then deported from Czechoslovakia on May 7, 1965, [115] [117]  by order of the StB. [118]   V\u00e1clav Havel  points to Ginsberg as an important inspiration. [119]One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about homosexuality. Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people. In 1943, he discovered within himself \"mountains of homosexuality.\" He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry. [120]  He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing  Peter Orlovsky , his lifelong companion, as his spouse in his  Who's Who  entry. Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor. [105]In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent, he challenged\u2014and ultimately changed\u2014obscenity laws. He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws ( William S. Burroughs  and  Lenny Bruce , for example).Ginsberg was a supporter and member of the  North American Man/Boy Love Association  (NAMBLA), a  pedophilia  and  pederasty  advocacy organization in the United States that works to abolish age of consent laws and legalize sexual relations between adults and children. [121] [ citation needed ]  Saying that he joined the organization \"in defense of free speech\", [122]  Ginsberg stated: \"Attacks on NAMBLA stink of politics, witchhunting for profit, humorlessness, vanity, anger and ignorance ... I'm a member of NAMBLA because I love boys too\u2014everybody does, who has a little humanity\". [123]  In 1994, Ginsberg appeared in a documentary on NAMBLA called  Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys  (playing on  the gay male slang term \"Chickenhawk\" ), in which he read a \"graphic ode to youth\". [121]  He read his poem \"Sweet Boy, Gimme Yr Ass\" from the book  Mind Breaths . [124]In her 2002 book  Heartbreak ,  Andrea Dworkin  claimed Ginsberg had ulterior motives for allying with NAMBLA. [125]  In reference to his onetime friend Dworkin, [126]  Ginsberg stated:I've known Andrea since she was a student. I had a conversation with her when I said I've had many young affairs, [with men who were] 16, 17, or 18. I said, 'What are you going to do, send me to jail?' And she said, 'You should be shot.' The problem is, she was molested when she was young, and she hasn't recovered from the trauma, and she's taking it out on ordinary lovers. [127]Ginsberg talked often about drug use. He organized the New York City chapter of LeMar (Legalize Marijuana). [128]  Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of  LSD , and, with  Timothy Leary , worked to promote its common use. He remained for many decades an advocate of  marijuana legalization , and, at the same time, warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his  Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Don't Smoke):  \"Don't Smoke Don't Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No / No don't smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope.\" [129]Ginsberg worked closely with  Alfred W. McCoy [130]  on the latter's book  The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , which claimed that the  CIA  was knowingly involved in the production of heroin in the  Golden Triangle  of  Burma , Thailand, and Laos. [131]  In addition to working with McCoy, Ginsberg personally confronted  Richard Helms , the director of the CIA in the 1970s, about the matter, but Helms denied that the CIA had anything to do with selling illegal drugs. [130] [132]  Ginsberg wrote many essays and articles, researching and compiling evidence of the CIA's alleged involvement in drug trafficking, but it took ten years, and the publication of McCoy's book in 1972, before anyone took him seriously. [130]  In 1978, Ginsberg received a note from the chief editor of  The New York Times , apologizing for not having taken his allegations seriously. [133]  The political subject is dealt with in his song/poem \"CIA Dope calypso\".  The  United States Department of State  responded to McCoy's initial allegations stating that they were \"unable to find any evidence to substantiate them, much less proof.\" [134]   Subsequent investigations by the  Inspector General of the CIA , [135]   United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs , [136]  and United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, a.k.a. the  Church Committee , [137]  also found the charges to be unsubstantiated.Most of Ginsberg's very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father, and of his idol  William Blake . His admiration for the writing of  Jack Kerouac  inspired him to take poetry more seriously. In 1955, upon the advice of a psychiatrist, Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry. [138]  Soon after, he wrote  Howl , the poem that brought him and his  Beat Generation  contemporaries to national attention and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life. Later in life, Ginsberg entered academia, teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at  Brooklyn College  from 1986 until his death. [139]Ginsberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouac's concept of \" spontaneous prose .\" He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions. Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac. For example, when Kerouac saw the first draft of  Howl , he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil (transposing \"negro\" and \"angry\" in the first line, for example). Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of spontaneous prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry. [140]The inspiration for  Howl  was Ginsberg's friend,  Carl Solomon , and  Howl  is dedicated to him. Solomon was a  Dada  and  Surrealism  enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to  Artaud ) who had bouts of clinical depression. Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a  lobotomy . The institution refused, giving him many forms of  therapy , including  electroshock therapy . Much of the final section of the first part of  Howl  is a description of this.Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of \" Moloch .\" Moloch, to whom the second section is addressed, is a  Levantine god  to whom children were sacrificed. Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the  Kenneth Rexroth  poem \"Thou Shalt Not Kill,\" a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes,  Dylan Thomas . Moloch is mentioned a few times in the  Torah  and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are frequent in his work. Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by  peyote  visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities). [141]  Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of  Fritz Lang 's film  Metropolis  (1927) and of the woodcut novels of  Lynd Ward . [41]  Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post-World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms. [142]He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of humanity in multiple aspects, in that the decision to  defy  socially created systems of control\u2014and therefore go against Moloch\u2014is a form of self-destruction. Many of the characters Ginsberg references in  Howl , such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle. The personal aspects of  Howl  are perhaps as important as the political aspects. Carl Solomon, the prime example of a \"best mind\" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line \"with mother finally fucked\" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: \"I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.\" Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write  Howl  was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly. He dealt with it directly with 1959's  Kaddish , [143]  which had its first public reading at a  Catholic Worker  Friday Night meeting, possibly due to its associations with  Thomas Merton . [144]Ginsberg's poetry was strongly influenced by  Modernism  (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams),  Romanticism  (specifically William Blake and  John Keats ), the beat and cadence of  jazz  (specifically that of  bop  musicians such as  Charlie Parker ), and his  Kagyu   Buddhist  practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist  William Blake , the American poet  Walt Whitman  and the Spanish poet  Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca . The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, as well as its  New World  exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed. [145] [105] [119]He corresponded with  William Carlos Williams , who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem  Paterson  about the industrial city near his home. After attending a reading by Williams, Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter. Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like \"thee.\" Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg, \"In this mode perfection is basic, and these poems are not perfect.\" [146] [105] [119]Though he disliked these early poems, Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsberg's letter. He included the letter in a later part of  Paterson . He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters, but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American. From Williams, Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images, in line with Williams' own motto \"No ideas but in things.\" Studying Williams' style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose, colloquial  free verse  style. Early breakthrough poems include  Bricklayer's Lunch Hour  and  Dream Record . [147] [119]Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of  Antonin Artaud  ( To Have Done with the Judgement of God  and  Van Gogh: The Man Suicided by Society ), and  Jean Genet  ( Our Lady of the Flowers ).  Philip Lamantia  introduced him to other  Surrealists  and Surrealism continued to be an influence (for example, sections of \"Kaddish\" were inspired by  Andr\u00e9 Breton 's  Free Union ). Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of  Howl  and other poems was inspired by  Christopher Smart  in such poems as  Jubilate Agno . Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences, such as:  Franz Kafka ,  Herman Melville ,  Fyodor Dostoevsky ,  Edgar Allan Poe , and  Emily Dickinson . [148] [105]Ginsberg also made an intense study of  haiku  and the paintings of  Paul C\u00e9zanne , from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the  Eyeball Kick . He noticed in viewing C\u00e9zanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would  spasm , or \"kick.\" Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was \"hydrogen jukebox\" (which later became the title of a  song cycle  composed by  Philip Glass  with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems). Another example is Ginsberg's observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan's hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fueled by a cocktail of amphetamines, [149]  opiates, [150]  alcohol, [151]  and psychedelics, [152]  as a  Dexedrine  Clown . The phrases \"eyeball kick\" and \"hydrogen jukebox\" both show up in  Howl , as well as a direct quote from C\u00e9zanne: \"Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus\". [105]Allen Ginsberg also found inspiration in music. He frequently included music in his poetry, invariably composing his tunes on an old Indian harmonium, which he often played during his readings. [153]  He wrote and recorded music to accompany  William Blake 's  Songs of Innocence  and  Songs of Experience . He also recorded a handful of other albums. To create music for  Howl  and  Wichita Vortex Sutra , he worked with the minimalist composer,  Philip Glass .Ginsberg worked with, drew inspiration from, and inspired artists such as  Bob Dylan ,  The Clash ,  Patti Smith , [154]   Phil Ochs , and  The Fugs . [54]  He worked with Dylan on various projects and maintained a friendship with him over many years. [155]In 1981, Ginsberg recorded a song called \"Birdbrain.\" He was backed by the Gluons, and the track was released as a single. [156]  In 1996, he recorded a song co-written with  Paul McCartney  and Philip Glass, \"The Ballad of the Skeletons\", [157]  which reached number 8 on the  Triple J Hottest 100  for that year.From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends\u2014not to mention his own experiments\u2014Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that's easily identified as Ginsbergian. [158]  Ginsberg stated that Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form. [159] [105] [119]Many of Ginsberg's early long line experiments contain some sort of  anaphora , repetition of a \"fixed base\" (for example \"who\" in  Howl , \"America\" in  America ) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg's style. [160]  He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence; he did not yet trust \"free flight.\" [161]  In the 1960s, after employing it in some sections of  Kaddish  (\"caw\" for example) he, for the most part, abandoned the anaphoric form. 'Latter-Day Beat' Bob Dylan is known for using anaphora, as in 'Tangled Up in Blue' where the phrase, returned to at the end of every verse, takes the place of a chorus. [105] [119]Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems. In the original draft of  Howl , each line is in a \"stepped triadic\" format reminiscent of  William Carlos Williams . [162]  He abandoned the \"stepped triadic\" when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later, most significantly in the travelogues of  The Fall of America . [ citation needed ]   Howl  and  Kaddish , arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections. In  America , he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines. [105] [119]Ginsberg's mature style made use of many specific, highly developed techniques, which he expressed in the \"poetic slogans\" he used in his Naropa teaching. Prominent among these was the inclusion of his unedited mental associations so as to reveal the mind at work (\"First thought, best thought.\" \"Mind is shapely, thought is shapely.\") He preferred expression through carefully observed physical details rather than abstract statements (\"Show, don't tell.\" \"No ideas but in things.\") [163]  In these he carried on and developed traditions of modernism in writing that are also found in Kerouac and Whitman.In  Howl  and in his other poetry, Ginsberg drew inspiration from the  epic ,  free verse  style of the 19th-century American poet  Walt Whitman . [164]  Both wrote passionately about the promise (and betrayal) of American democracy, the central importance of erotic experience, and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence.  J. D. McClatchy , editor of the  Yale Review , called Ginsberg \"the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.\" McClatchy added that Ginsberg, like Whitman, \"was a bard in the old manner\u2014outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era's psyche, with all its contradictory urges.\" McClatchy's barbed eulogies define the essential difference between Ginsberg (\"a beat poet whose writing was [...] journalism raised by combining the recycling genius with a generous mimic-empathy, to strike audience-accessible chords; always lyrical and sometimes truly poetic\") and Kerouac (\"a poet of singular brilliance, the brightest luminary of a 'beat generation' he came to symbolise in popular culture [...] [though] in reality he far surpassed his contemporaries [...] Kerouac is an originating genius, exploring then answering\u2014like  Rimbaud  a century earlier, by necessity more than by choice\u2014the demands of authentic self-expression as applied to the evolving quicksilver mind of America's only literary virtuoso [...]\"). [18]His collection  The Fall of America  shared the annual U.S.  National Book Award for Poetry  in 1974. [14]  In 1979, he received the  National Arts Club  gold medal and was inducted into the  American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters . [165]  Ginsberg was a  Pulitzer Prize  finalist in 1995 for his book  Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986\u20131992 . [16]  In 1993, he received a  John Jay Award  posthumously from Columbia. [166] [167]In 2014, Ginsberg was one of the inaugural honorees in the  Rainbow Honor Walk , a  walk of fame  in San Francisco's  Castro neighborhood  noting  LGBTQ  people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\" [168] [169] [170].",
        "response": "## Allen Ginsberg: A Poet of the Beat Generation\n\nAllen Ginsberg, born in 1926, was a pivotal figure in the Beat Generation, a literary movement that emerged in the 1950s and challenged societal norms with its raw, unfiltered expression. Ginsberg's poetry, marked by its honesty and social critique, left an indelible mark on American counterculture. His most famous work, \"Howl,\" brought him worldwide fame and became a symbol of the Beat Generation.\n\nGinsberg grew up in a family immersed in the New York literary counterculture of the 1920s. His mother, a supporter of the Communist Party, struggled with mental health issues, which had a profound impact on Ginsberg. As a teenager, he discovered the works of Walt Whitman, and his early poems were influenced by traditional rhyme and meter. However, a pivotal moment in his literary journey came when he discovered the poetry of William Carlos Williams, who encouraged him to embrace a more colloquial, free-verse style.\n\nIn the 1940s, while studying at Columbia University, Ginsberg formed close friendships with Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady, who would become leading figures of the Beat movement. Ginsberg was inspired by Kerouac's concept of \"spontaneous prose,\" and his own writing began to reflect a more spontaneous, unfiltered style. He also drew inspiration from the epic, free-verse poetry of Walt Whitman, incorporating Whitman's long lines and raw emotional expression into his work.\n\nIn 1954, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco, where he became a part of the city's thriving literary scene. It was here that he wrote \"Howl,\" a poem that served as a scathing critique of a destructive and repressive society. The poem's raw language and explicit content led to obscenity charges, resulting in a landmark trial that ultimately ruled in favor of the poem's artistic value. \"Howl\" brought Ginsberg widespread recognition and established him as a leading voice of the Beat Generation.\n\nGinsberg's poetry often reflected his political and social concerns. He was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and actively participated in anti-war protests. He also advocated for free speech and gay rights, and his openness about his homosexuality was groundbreaking at a time when it was still widely taboo. Ginsberg's work challenged societal norms and pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in literature, making him a controversial yet influential figure.\n\nIn addition to \"Howl,\" Ginsberg published numerous other collections, including \"Kaddish and Other Poems\" (1961) and \"The Fall of America\" (1973), which won the National Book Award. He was also known for his interest in Eastern religions and spiritual practices, which influenced his writing. Ginsberg's later years were marked by his battle with illness, and he passed away in 1997, leaving behind a legacy of fearless, boundary-pushing poetry.\n\nAllen Ginsberg's poetry, with its raw honesty and social critique, continues to resonate and inspire new generations of poets and readers. His fearless exploration of taboo subjects and his commitment to artistic freedom have secured his place as one of the most influential poets of the 20th century.",

They wrote things like \"Quies, or Rest\" by AllenGrossman from THE BRIGHT NAILSSCATTERED ON THE GROUND, published by New Directions (1986).(buy now). Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Allen Grossman is the author of\u00a0Sweet Youth: Poems by a Young Man and an Old Man, Old and New 1953\u20132001\u00a0(New Directions, 2002)., Poet and critic Allen R. Grossman occupies a unique position in contemporary American letters: though influenced by the modernism and postmodernism that shaped so many poets of his generation, Grossman did not align himself with any one poetic community. Instead, his poetry is often described as coming out of the modern Romantic tradition of lyric poetry, and he writes in a high style, reflecting the influence of William Butler Yeats, Wallace Stevens, and Hart Crane. According to the late poet and critic Reginald Shepherd, &ldquo;Grossman shares the Romantic and High Modernist exalted idea of the poet&rsquo;s vocation and of the power of poetry to engage and encompass the world on equal terms &hellip; Though his poetry is not devoid of irony or even humor, Grossman is never embarrassed or ironic about the greatness he believes poetry to be capable of making apparent, nor about his own ambitions to approach such greatness, although in his view its attainment is impossible: to write the perfect poem would be to reach the end of poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp;A noted scholar, Grossman&rsquo;s book&nbsp;The Sighted Singer: Two Works on Poetry for Writers and Readers (1992), which he wrote with Mark Halliday, remains a kind of cult classic of poetics. The work addresses the philosophical implications of lyric poetry and&nbsp;lays out Grossman&rsquo;s own understanding of the nature of poetic address.\r\n\r\nGrossman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He earned his BA and MA from Harvard and his PhD from Brandeis University in 1960. He taught for many years at both Brandeis, where he was the Paul E. Prosswimmer Professor of Poetry and General Education;&nbsp;and Johns Hopkins University, where he was the Emeritus Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities. His many honors and awards included a MacArthur Foundation &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; Award, the Bassine Citation of the Academy of American Poets, the Witter Bynner Prize for Poetry from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, a nomination for the National Book Critics Circle Award for his book&nbsp;The Ether Dome&nbsp;(1992), and, in 2009, the prestigious Yale Bollingen Prize. He also served as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science.\r\n\r\nInvested in lyric poetry&rsquo;s impulse to embody experience precisely, Grossman&rsquo;s poetry also displays a distrust of its ability to fix feeling accurately. In books like A Harlot&rsquo;s Hire (1962) and The Woman on the Bridge over the Chicago River (1979), Grossman began to formulate his poetics in poems that were at once narrative and philosophical. Grossman&rsquo;s The Ether Dome was described by critic William Doreski for the Literary Review as representing &ldquo;a long devotion to poetry not as a quasi-career but as a way of understanding the world.&rdquo; Grossman&rsquo;s later work has also received praise for its continued devotion to exploring the intersections of poetry, philosophy, and autobiography. In the Boston Review, James Longenbach described How to Do Things with Tears (2001) as Grossman&rsquo;s &ldquo;wildest creation yet.&rdquo; The material in this book, Longenbach claimed, could have filled ten books. Though the poems are &ldquo;stuffed with characters, voices and idioms,&rdquo; there is a unifying voice, Longenbach wrote, that makes a singular statement: &ldquo;Poetry is what we do with memories, and remembering is what we do with tears.&rdquo; In Descartes&rsquo; Loneliness (2007), Grossman imaginatively inhabits the figure of Descartes and the precepts of his philosophy, penning letters to Princess Elizabeth. However, the book is also concerned with Grossman&rsquo;s own family history. As Publisher&rsquo;s Weekly noted, these more personal lyrics showcase Grossman&rsquo;s &ldquo;interest&mdash;or better, faith&mdash;in poetry&rsquo;s capacity to perform distinctly human acts of preservation.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCritic Geoffrey Hartman wrote,&nbsp;&rdquo;Grossman&rsquo;s poems, a continuous act of confrontation, brave comparison with verses that today are sacred&nbsp;as&nbsp;verse, untouchable in their strength.&rdquo; Scholar Robert Fitzgerald added,&nbsp;&ldquo;The reader who takes up these poems will appreciate at once the altogether distinctive beauty of lines and phrases &hellip; falling as unlaboredly on the page as light falls through a framing window on a wall.&nbsp; The prosodic or musical achievement is itself a rare one amid the poetries of the time, and like most fine art comes of long study and the intense exercise of choice.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGrossman died in Chelsea, Massachusetts in 2014., Allen R.

        "reflected_response": " Early Life and Education: \nEmily Elizabeth Dickinson, one the America's most renowned and enigmatic poets, was born on December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was a lawyer and treasurer at Amherst College, and her mother, Emily Norcross Dickinson, was a deeply religious homemaker. Dickinson grew up in a supportive and stable environment with her two siblings, Austin and Lavinia. She received her primary education at Amherst Academy, where she excelled in her studies and displayed an early interest in poetry and literature. \n\nCareer:\nDespite her talent and passion for writing, Dickinson chose to lead a reclusive life, rarely venturing outside her familial estate in Amherst. She never actively sought publication of her poetry during her lifetime. Most of her nearly 1800 poems were discovered after her death, carefully preserved in hand-sewn booklets hidden in a chest in her bedroom. These poems reveal a profound exploration of themes such as nature, mortality, spirituality, and the human condition. \n\nPoetic Style and Influences:\nDickinson's poetry is known for its unique style, characterized by short lines, slant rhyme, and unconventional capitalization and punctuation. She often employed imaginative and innovative language to convey deep emotional states and complex philosophical ideas. Her work was influenced by her extensive reading, including William Wordsworth, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the Bible. She also engaged in thoughtful correspondence with writer friends, such as Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Helen Hunt Jackson, who encouraged and supported her writing. \n\nAwards and Recognition:\nThough largely unrecognized during her lifetime, Dickinson's genius was eventually brought to light. Today, she is widely regarded as a pioneering figure in American poetry, known for her innovative use of form and language. Many scholars consider her to be one the greatest poets in the English language. \n\nLater Life and Legacy\nEmily Dickinson passed away on May 15, 1886, at the age of 55. The exact cause of her death was never confirmed, but it is believed to be due to either kidney disease or Bright's disease. Her legacy continues to inspire and influence poets, writers, and readers worldwide. Her poems have been widely published and translated, ensuring her a permanent place in literary history. Additionally, her life and work have been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, and scholarly studies, attesting to her enduring fascination for audiences of all generations. \n\nEmily Dickinson, through her solitary genius, has left an indelible mark on the literary world, forever changing how we perceive and appreciate poetry. \n\n> \"Forever \u2013 is composed of Nows\u2014\" \n - Emily Dickinson"

He attended high school in Warsaw, Indiana.  Throughout his career, Ambrose was an  editorialist, journalist, short-story writer and satirist.  His cynical and often fervent views as a critic earned him the nickname, \"Bitter Bierce\".  He was also a distinguished hero in the American Civil War.  He disappeared mysteriously in 1914.His father was Marcus Aurelius Bierce (1799-1876) and his mother was Laura Sherwood who was a descendant of William Bradford.  He was the tenth of thirteen children, all of them had names beginning with the letter \"A\".  In the order that they were born, the children\u2019s names were: Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Almeda, Andrew, Albert, Ambrose, Arthur, Adelia, and Aurelia. \n\nIn 1857, Ambrose worked as a printer\u2019s assistant for The Northern Indianian in Warsaw.  In 1859, he attended the Kentucky Military Institute for one year.  He worked in a brickyard in 1860. At the start of the Civil War, Ambrose enlisted as a private in Company C of the Ninth Regiment, Indiana Volunteers.  He saw his first military action in June of 1861.  On July 10, 1861, he heroically saves a mortally wounded soldier while under heavy Confedrate fire.  He re-enlists with the rank of sergeant in August of 1861.  In 1862, Ambrose fought in several battles including Shiloh and was promoted to lieutenant.  He re-enlisted for a third tour in 1864 and was wounded in the head by a sniper, and promoted to brevet captain.  He mustered out of the military in 1865 and was given the honorary title of brevet major for his distinguished service and began his first serious writing.  \n\nAmbrose moved to San Francisco and published his first poem in 1867.  It was followed with non-fiction articles in the Californian.  In 1868, he joined the staff of the News-Letter and soon became the editor.  He published his first short story in 1871 and married Mary Ellen (Mollie) Day.

In 1887 he was hired by William Randolph Hearst as columnist and editor for the San Francisco Examiner at which time he began publishing his Civil War stories.  He separated from Mollie in 1888.  In 1889, his son Day, who was 17 at the time, died when he shot and killed his rival in a love triangle and then himself.  Between 1890 and 1899 Ambrose published many more works and moved to Washington DC.  In 1901, his second son, Leigh died of pneumonia.  In 1904 Mollie filed for divorce, she died the following year.  In 1906 he published his most famous work, The Devil\u2019s Dictionary which makes interesting reinterpretations of the English language, while hypocrisy and political rhetoric are lampooned.  In 1909 publication of his Collected Works, in 12 volumes, began.\n\nAmbrose Bierce resigned from his writing posts and traveled the country.  In 1913 he was attracted by the Mexican revolution and decided to get involved at the age of seventy-one.  In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez he joined Pancho Villa's army as an observer, and witnessed the battle of Tierra Blanca.  Bierce accompanied Villa's army as far as Chihuahua, Chihuahua. He sent a last letter to a close friend from there on December 26, 1913, then he vanished without a trace.  He became one of the most famous disappearances in American literary history.\n\nIn one of his last letters, Bierce wrote the following to his niece, Lora:\n\n\"Good-bye \u2014 if you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone wall and shot to rags please know that I think that a pretty good way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling down the cellar stairs. To be a Gringo in Mexico \u2014 ah, that is euthanasia!\"\n\nThe disappearance of Ambrose Bierce was investigated by the US government and separately by his daughter Helen to no avail.  Theories and unsubstantiated rumors abounded, but nothing was ever learned and his disappearance and death remain a mystery today.  The year of his death is put as 1914, but no one really knows when he died., Ambrose Bierce&#39;s literary reputation is based primarily on his short stories about the Civil War and the supernatural&mdash;a body of work that makes up a relatively small part of his total output. Often compared to the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, these stories share an attraction to death in its more bizarre forms, featuring depictions of mental deterioration, uncanny and otherworldly manifestations, and the horror of existence in a meaningless universe. Like Poe, Bierce professed to be mainly concerned with the artistry of his work, yet critics find him more intent on conveying his misanthropy and pessimism. His bare, economical style of supernatural horror is usually distinguished from the verbally lavish tales of Poe. In his lifetime, Bierce was famous as a California journalist dedicated to exposing the truth as he understood it, regardless of whose reputations were harmed by his attacks. For his sardonic wit and damning observations on the personalities and events of the day, he became known as &quot;the wickedest man in San Francisco.&quot;\r\n\r\nBierce was born in Meigs County, Ohio. His parents were farmers and he was the tenth of 13 children, all of whom were given names beginning with &quot;A&quot; at their father&#39;s insistence. The family moved to Indiana, where Bierce went to high school; he later attended the Kentucky Military Institute. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the Union army. In such units as the Ninth Indiana Infantry Regiment and Buell&#39;s Army of the Ohio, he fought bravely in numerous military engagements, including the battles of Shiloh and Chickamauga and in Sherman&#39;s March to the Sea. After the war Bierce traveled with a military expedition to San Francisco, where he left the army and began a literary career.\r\n\r\nBierce published two books of poetry, Black Beetles in Amber (1892) and Shapes of Clay (1903), which were later published as the fourth and fifth volumes in his Collected Works (1909-1912). A talented critic and satirist, his poems and other works were published in numerous newspaper columns for over 40 years, beginning with the Californian. In 1868 he became the editor of The News Letter, for which he wrote his famous &quot;Town Crier&quot; column. Bierce became something of a noted figure in California literary society, forming friendships with Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and Joaquin Miller. In 1872 Bierce and his wife moved to England where, during a three-year stay, he wrote for Fun and Figaro magazines, acquiring the nickname &quot;Bitter Bierce.&quot; His first three books of sketches&mdash;Nuggets and Dust Panned Out in California (1872), The Fiend&#39;s Delight (1873), and Cobwebs from an Empty Skull (1874)&mdash;were published during this period. When the English climate aggravated Bierce&#39;s asthma he returned to San Francisco. In 1887 he began writing for William Randolph Hearst&#39;s San Francisco Examiner, continuing the &quot;Prattler&quot; column he had done for the Argonaut and the Wasp. Bierce relocated to Washington, DC in 1896, where he continued to publish poems, essays, epigrams, and short stories in newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nBierce&#39;s major fiction was collected in Tales of Soldiers and Civilians (1891) and Can Such Things Be? (1893). Many of these stories are realistic depictions of the author&#39;s experiences in the Civil War. However, Bierce was not striving for realism, as critics have pointed out and as he himself admitted, for his narratives often fail to supply sufficient verisimilitude. His most striking fictional effects depend on an adept manipulation of the reader viewpoint: a bloody battlefield seen through the eyes of a deaf child in &quot;Chickamauga,&quot; the deceptive escape dreamed by a man about to be hanged in &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,&quot; and the shifting perspectives of &quot;The Death of Halpin Frayser.&quot; The classic Biercian narrative includes a marked use of black humor, particularly in the ironic and hideous deaths his protagonists often suffer. The brutal satire Bierce employed in his journalism appears as plain brutality in his fiction, and critics have both condemned and praised his imagination as among the most vicious and morbid in American literature.\r\n\r\nAlong with his tales of terror, Bierce&#39;s most acclaimed work is The Devil&#39;s Dictionary (1906), a lexicon of its author&#39;s wit and animosity. His definition for &quot;ghost&quot;&mdash;&quot;the outward and visible sign of an inward fear&quot;&mdash;clarifies his fundamentally psychological approach to the supernatural. In The Devil&#39;s Dictionary, Bierce vented much of his contempt for politics, religion, society, and conventional human values. A committed opponent of hypocrisy, prejudice, and corruption, Bierce acquired the public persona of an admired but often hated genius, a man of contradiction and mystery. In 1913 he informed many of his correspondents that he intended to travel Mexico and join Pancho Villa&#39;s forces as an observer during that country&#39;s civil war. He was never heard from again, and the circumstances of his death are uncertain., Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce  (June 24, 1842 [2]  \u2013  c. \u20091914 [3] ) was an American short story writer, journalist, poet, and  American Civil War  veteran. His book  The Devil's Dictionary  was named one of \"The 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature\" by the  American Revolution Bicentennial Administration . [4]   His story \" An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge \" has been described as \"one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature\", [5]  and his book  Tales of Soldiers and Civilians  (also published as  In the Midst of Life ) was named by the  Grolier Club  one of the 100 most influential American books printed before 1900. [6]A prolific and versatile writer, Bierce was regarded as one of the most influential journalists in the United States [7] [8]  and as a pioneering writer of realist fiction. [9]  For his horror writing,  Michael Dirda  ranked him alongside  Edgar Allan Poe  and  H. P. Lovecraft . [10]   S. T. Joshi  speculates that he may well be the greatest satirist America has ever produced, and in this regard can take his place with such figures as  Juvenal ,  Swift , and  Voltaire . [11]  His war stories influenced  Stephen Crane ,  Ernest Hemingway , and others, [12]  and he was considered an influential and feared literary critic. [13]  In recent decades, Bierce has gained wider respect as a  fabulist  and for his poetry. [14] [15]In 1913, Bierce told reporters that he was travelling to Mexico to gain first-hand experience of the  Mexican Revolution . [16]  He disappeared and was never seen again.Bierce was born in a log cabin at Horse Cave Creek in  Meigs County, Ohio , on June 24, 1842, to Marcus Aurelius Bierce (1799\u20131876) and Laura Sherwood Bierce. [2]   He was of entirely English ancestry: all of his forebears came to North America between 1620 and 1640 as part of the Great Puritan Migration. [17]   He often wrote critically of \"Puritan values\" and people who \"made a fuss\" about genealogy. [18]  He was the tenth of thirteen children,  all of whom were given names by their father beginning with the letter \"A\": in order of birth, the Bierce siblings were Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Almeda, Andrew, Albert, Ambrose, Arthur, Adelia, and Aurelia. [19]  His mother was a descendant of  William Bradford . [20]His parents were a poor but literary couple who instilled in him a deep love for books and writing. [2]  Bierce grew up in  Kosciusko County , Indiana, attending high school at the  county seat ,  Warsaw .He left home at 15 to become a  printer's devil  at a small  abolitionist  newspaper, the  Northern Indianan . [2]Bierce briefly attended the  Kentucky Military Institute  until it burned down. [21]  At the start of the  American Civil War , he enlisted in the  Union Army 's  9th Indiana Infantry . He participated in the  operations in Western Virginia  (1861), was present at the  Battle of Philippi  (the first organized land action of the war) and received newspaper attention for his daring rescue, under fire, of a gravely wounded comrade at the  Battle of Rich Mountain . Bierce fought at the  Battle of Shiloh  (April 1862), a terrifying experience that became a source for several short stories and the memoir \"What I Saw of Shiloh\". [22] [23]In April 1863 he was commissioned a  first lieutenant , and served on the staff of General  William Babcock Hazen  as a  topographical engineer , making maps of likely battlefields. [24]  As a staff officer, Bierce became known to leading generals such as  George H. Thomas  and  Oliver O. Howard , both of whom supported his application for admission to  West Point  in May 1864. General  Hazen  believed Bierce would graduate from the military academy \"with distinction\" and  William T. Sherman  also endorsed the application for admission, even though stating he had no personal acquaintance with Bierce. [25]  In June 1864, Bierce sustained a  traumatic brain injury  at the  Battle of Kennesaw Mountain  and spent the rest of the summer on furlough, returning to active duty in September. [26] [27]  He was discharged from the army in January 1865.His military career resumed in mid-1866, when he joined General Hazen as part of an expedition to inspect military outposts across the  Great Plains . The expedition traveled by horseback and wagon from  Omaha, Nebraska , arriving toward year's end in San Francisco, California. In the city, Bierce was awarded the rank of  brevet   major  before resigning from the Army.Bierce remained in San Francisco for many years, eventually becoming famous as a contributor or editor of newspapers and periodicals, including  The San Francisco News Letter ,  The Argonaut , the  Overland Monthly ,  The Californian  and  The Wasp . A selection of his crime reporting from  The San Francisco News Letter  was included in the  Library of America  anthology  True Crime .Bierce lived and wrote in England from 1872 to 1875, contributing to  Fun  magazine. His first book,  The Fiend's Delight , a compilation of his articles, was published in London in 1873 by  John Camden Hotten  under the pseudonym \"Dod Grile\". [28] [29]Returning to the United States, he again took up residence in San Francisco. From 1879 to 1880, he traveled to  Rockerville  and  Deadwood  in the  Dakota Territory , to try his hand as local manager for a New York mining company. When the company failed he returned to San Francisco and resumed his career in journalism.From January 1, 1881, until September 11, 1885, he was editor of  The Wasp  magazine, in which he began a column titled \"Prattle\". He also became one of the first regular columnists and editorialists on  William Randolph Hearst 's newspaper, the  San Francisco Examiner , [2]  eventually becoming one of the most prominent and influential writers and journalists [ citation needed ]  on the  West Coast . He remained associated with  Hearst Newspapers  until 1909. [30]The  Union Pacific  and  Central Pacific  railroad companies had received large, low-interest loans from the U.S. government to build the  first transcontinental railroad . Central Pacific executive  Collis P. Huntington  persuaded a friendly member of  Congress  to introduce a bill excusing the companies from repaying the loans, amounting  to $130 million (worth $4.57 billion today).In January 1896 Hearst dispatched Bierce to  Washington, D.C. , to foil this attempt. The essence of the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce on the steps of the  Capitol  and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: \"My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when you are ready to pay, I happen to be out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States.\" [31]Bierce's coverage and diatribes on the subject aroused such public wrath that the bill was defeated. Bierce returned to California in November.In 1899, he moved back to Washington, D.C., and remained a resident until his disappearance in 1913. The best known of his four different residences in the city during this time perhaps is the townhouse at 18  Logan Circle . [32]Bierce's long newspaper career was often controversial because of his penchant for biting social criticism and satire. On several occasions his columns stirred up a storm of hostile reaction, which created difficulties for Hearst. One of the most notable of these incidents occurred following the  assassination  of President  William McKinley  in 1901 when Hearst's opponents turned a poem Bierce had written about the assassination of Governor  William Goebel  of Kentucky in 1900 into a  cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre .Bierce meant his poem to express a national mood of dismay and fear, but after McKinley was shot in 1901, it seemed to foreshadow the crime:The bullet that pierced Goebel's breast \nCan not be found in all the West; \nGood reason, it is speeding here \nTo stretch McKinley on his bier.Hearst was thereby accused by rival newspapers\u2014and by then- Secretary of War   Elihu Root \u2014of having called for McKinley's assassination. Despite a national uproar that ended his ambitions for the presidency (and even his membership in the  Bohemian Club ), Hearst kept employing Bierce. [33]During his lifetime, Bierce was better known as a journalist than as a fiction writer.  His most popular stories were written in rapid succession between 1888 and 1891, in what was characterized as \"a tremendous burst of consummate art\". [34]  Bierce's works often highlight the inscrutability of the universe and the  absurdity of death . [35] [36]Bierce wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the  war [37]  in such stories as \" An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge \", \" A Horseman in the Sky \", \" One of the Missing \", and \" Chickamauga \". His grimly realistic cycle of 25 war stories has been called \"the greatest anti-war document in American literature\". To the end of his life, nothing would so infuriate him as hearing accounts of the honor and glory of war from people who'd never seen or experienced it personally. [38]According to  Milton Subotsky , Bierce helped pioneer the  psychological horror  story. [39]  In addition to his ghost and war stories, he also published several volumes of poetry.  His  Fantastic Fables  anticipated the ironic style of  grotesquerie  that became a more common genre in the 20th century.One of Bierce's most famous works is his much-quoted  The Devil's Dictionary , originally an occasional newspaper item, first published in book form in 1906 as  The Cynic's Word Book.  Described as \"howlingly funny\", [40]  it consists of satirical definitions of English words which lampoon  cant  and political double-talk. Bierce edited the twelve volumes of  The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce , which were published from 1909 to 1912. The seventh volume consists solely of  The Devil's Dictionary .Bierce has been criticized by his contemporaries and later scholars for deliberately pursuing improbability and for his penchant toward \" trick endings \". [35]  In his later stories, apparently under the influence of  Maupassant , Bierce \"dedicated himself to shocking the audience\", as if his purpose was \"to attack the reader's smug intellectual security\". [41]Bierce's bias towards  Naturalism  has also been noted: [42]  \"The biting, deriding quality of his satire, unbalanced by any compassion for his targets, was often taken as petty meanness, showing contempt for humanity and an intolerance to the point of merciless cruelty\". [43]Stephen Crane  was of the minority of Bierce's contemporaries who valued Bierce's experimental short stories. [44]   In his essay \" Supernatural Horror in Literature \",  H. P. Lovecraft  characterized Bierce's fictional work as \"grim and savage.\"  Lovecraft goes on to say that nearly all of Bierce's stories are of the  horror genre  and some shine as great examples of  weird fiction . [45]Critic and novelist   William Dean Howells  said, \"Mr. Bierce is among our three greatest writers.\" When told this, Bierce responded, \"I am sure Mr. Howells is the other two.\" [46]Bierce married Mary Ellen \"Mollie\" Day on December 25, 1871. They had three children: sons Day (1872\u20131889) [47]  and Leigh (1874\u20131901) [47]  and daughter Helen (1875\u20131940). Both of Bierce's sons died before he did. Day committed suicide after a romantic rejection (he non-fatally shot the woman of his affections along with her fianc\u00e9 beforehand), [48] [49]  and Leigh died of  pneumonia  related to alcoholism. [47]  Bierce separated from his wife in 1888, after discovering compromising letters to her from an admirer. They divorced in 1904. [47]  Mollie Day Bierce died the following year.Bierce was an avowed agnostic and strongly rejected the  divinity of Christ . [50]  He had lifelong  asthma , [51]  as well as complications from his war wounds, most notably episodes of fainting and irritability assignable to the traumatic brain injury experienced at Kennesaw Mountain. [26] [27]In October 1913, Bierce, then age 71, departed from Washington, D.C., for a tour of his old  Civil War  battlefields. According to some reports, by December he had passed through Louisiana and Texas, crossing by way of  El Paso  into Mexico, which was in the throes of  revolution . In  Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez  he joined  Pancho Villa 's army as an observer, and in that role he witnessed the  Battle of Tierra Blanca . [52]It was reported that Bierce accompanied Villa's army as far as the city of  Chihuahua . His last known communication with the world was a letter he wrote there to  Blanche Partington , a close friend, dated December 26, 1913. [53] [54] [55]  After closing this letter by saying, \"As to me, I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination,\"  he vanished without a trace , one of the most famous disappearances in American literary history.Bierce's ultimate fate continues to remain a mystery. He wrote in one of his final letters: \"Good-bye. If you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone wall and shot to rags, please know that I think it is a pretty good way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling down the cellar stairs. To be a Gringo in Mexico--ah, that is euthanasia!\" [56]Skeptic  Joe Nickell  noted that the letter to Partington had not been found; all that existed was a notebook belonging to his secretary and companion Carrie Christiansen. Partington concluded that Bierce deliberately concealed his true whereabouts when he finally went to a selected location in the  Grand Canyon  and died as a result of suicide. [57] [58]There was an official investigation by U.S. consular officials of the disappearance of one of its citizens. Some of Villa's men were questioned at the time of his disappearance and afterwards, with contradictory accounts. U.S. Army chief of staff  Hugh L. Scott  contacted Pancho Villa's U.S. representative  Felix A. Sommerfeld , and Sommerfeld investigated the disappearance. Bierce was said to have been last seen in the city of Chihuahua in January. [59]Oral tradition in  Sierra Mojada ,  Coahuila  documented by priest James Lienert states that Bierce was executed by firing squad in the town's cemetery. [60]Bierce has been fictionalized in more than 50 novels, short stories, movies, television shows, stage plays, and comic books. Most of these works draw upon Bierce's vivid personality, colorful wit, relationships with famous people such as  Jack London  and  William Randolph Hearst , or, quite frequently, his mysterious disappearance.Bierce has been portrayed by such well-known authors as  Ray Bradbury , [61]   Jack Finney , [62]   Carlos Fuentes , [63]   Winston Groom , [64]   Robert Heinlein , [65]  and Don Swaim. [66]  Some works featuring a fictional Ambrose Bierce have received favorable reviews, generated international sales, [67]  or earned major awards.Bierce's short stories, \"Haita the Shepherd\" and \" An Inhabitant of Carcosa \" are believed to have influenced early weird fiction writer  Robert W. Chambers ' tales of  The King in Yellow  (1895), which featured  Hastur ,  Carcosa , Lake Hali and other names and locations initiated in these tales. [68]  Chambers in turn went on to influence  H. P. Lovecraft  and much of modern horror fiction.In 1918,  H. L. Mencken  called Bierce \"the one genuine wit that These States have ever seen.\" [69]At least three films have been made of Bierce's story \" An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge \". A silent film version,  The Bridge , was made in 1929 by  Charles Vidor . [70]  A French version called  La Rivi\u00e8re du Hibou , directed by  Robert Enrico , was released in 1962; [71]  this black-and-white film faithfully recounts the original narrative using voiceover. It aired in 1964 on American television as one of the final episodes of the television series  The Twilight Zone : \" An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge \". [72]  Prior to  The Twilight Zone , the story had been adapted as an episode of  Alfred Hitchcock Presents . [73]  Another version, directed by Brian James Egen, was released in 2005. It was also adapted for the CBS radio programs  Escape  (1947),  Suspense  (1956, 1957, 1959), and  Radio Mystery Theater  (1974).In his 1932 book  Wild Talents , American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena  Charles Fort  wrote about the unexplained disappearances of Ambrose Bierce and  Ambrose Small , and asked, \"Was somebody collecting Ambroses?\" [74]Actor James Lanphier (1920\u20131969) played Bierce, with  James Hampton  as  William Randolph Hearst , in the 1964 episode \"The Paper Dynasty\", of the  syndicated   western  television series  Death Valley Days , hosted by  Stanley Andrews . In the story line, Hearst struggles to turn a profit despite increased circulation of the  San Francisco Examiner .  Robert O. Cornthwaite  appears as Sam Chamberlain. [75]Carlos Fuentes 's 1985 novel  The Old Gringo  is a fictionalized account of Bierce's disappearance; it was later adapted into the film  Old Gringo  (1989), starring  Gregory Peck  in the title role. [76]  Fuentes stated: \"What started this novel was my admiration for Ambrose Bierce and for his  Tales of Soldiers and Civilians .\" [77]Two adaptations were made of Bierce's story \"Eyes of the Panther\". One version was developed for  Shelley Duvall 's  Nightmare Classics  series and was released in 1990. It runs about 60 minutes. [78]  A shorter version was released in 2007 by director Michael Barton and runs about 23 minutes. [79]Bierce was a major character in a series of mystery books written by  Oakley Hall  and published between 1998 and 2006. [80]Biographer Richard O'Connor argued that, \"War was the making of Bierce as a man and a writer... [he became] truly capable of transferring the bloody, headless bodies and boar-eaten corpses of the battlefield onto paper.\" [2]Essayist  Clifton Fadiman  wrote, \"Bierce was never a great writer. He has painful faults of vulgarity and cheapness of imagination. But ... his style, for one thing, will preserve him; and the purity of his  misanthropy , too, will help to keep him alive.\" [2]Author Alan Gullette argues that Bierce's war tales may be the best writing on war, outranking his contemporary  Stephen Crane  (author of  The Red Badge of Courage ) and even  Ernest Hemingway . [2]The short film \"Ah! Silenciosa\" (1999), starring  Jim Beaver  as Bierce, weaves elements of \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" into a speculation on Bierce's disappearance. [81]Bierce's trip to Mexico and disappearance provide the background for the  vampire  horror film  From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter  (2000), in which Bierce's character plays a central role. [82]  Bierce's fate is the subject of  Gerald Kersh 's \"The Oxoxoco Bottle\" (aka \"The Secret of the Bottle\"), which appeared in  The Saturday Evening Post  on December 7, 1957, and was reprinted in the anthology  Men Without Bones . Bierce reappears in the future on  Mount Shasta  in  Robert Heinlein 's novella, \" Lost Legacy \".In the fall of 2001,  An Occurrence Remembered , a theatrical retelling of Bierce's  An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge  and  Chickamauga , premiered off-Broadway in New York City under the production and direction of  Lorin Morgan-Richards  and lead choreographer Nicole Cavaliere. [83]American composer  Rodney Waschka II  composed an opera,  Saint Ambrose  (2002), based on Bierce's life. [84]In 2002 the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco premiered a one-act version of Bierce's ultra-short story \"The Difficulty of Crossing a Field\" by American composer  David Lang .  The opera has since been performed by other companies. [85]In 2005, author  Kurt Vonnegut  stated that he considered \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" the \"greatest American short story\" and a work of \"flawless ... American genius\". [86]\" The Damned Thing \" was adapted twice. First time in 1975, into a Yugoslav TV-movie  Prokletinja . Second time, into a 2006  Masters of Horror  episode of the same title directed by  Tobe Hooper . [87]Don Swaim writes of Bierce's life and disappearance in  The Assassination of Ambrose Bierce: A Love Story  (2015). [88]Ambrose Bierce features as a character in  Winston Groom 's 2016 novel  El Paso . In the novel, Bierce is personally executed by Pancho Villa. [89]Weird-fiction critic and editor  S. T. Joshi  has cited Bierce as an influence on his own work, and has praised him for his satirical wit, saying \"Bierce will remain an equivocal figure in American and world literature chiefly because his dark view of humanity is, by its very nature, unpopular. Most people like writing that is cheerful and uplifting, even though a substantial proportion of the world's great literature is quite otherwise.\" [90] [91]Ambrose Bierce was a prolific writer of short fiction. He wrote 249 short stories, [92]  846 fables, [93]  and more than 300 humorous Little Johnny stories. [94]  The following list provides links to more information about notable stories by Bierce.

        "response": " certainly! Here is a biography of Ambrose Bierce, focusing on his literary style and including interesting facts about his life:\n\nAmbrose Gwinnett Bierce, often referred to as \"Bitter Bierce,\" was an American poet, short-story writer, journalist, editorialist, and satirist. He was born on June 24, 1842, in rural Meigs County, Ohio, and grew up in Kosciusko County, Indiana. Bierce was the tenth of thirteen children, all with names beginning with the letter \"A.\" His parents were farmers, and he was instilled with a deep love for books and writing from a young age.\n\nAt fifteen, Bierce left home to work as a printer's assistant for a small abolitionist newspaper, marking the beginning of his lifelong career in journalism. He briefly attended the Kentucky Military Institute before enlisting in the Union Army at the outbreak of the American Civil War. Bierce fought bravely in several battles, including Shiloh, and was promoted to lieutenant. He sustained a traumatic brain injury at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain and was discharged in 1865.\n\nAfter the war, Bierce joined an expedition to inspect military outposts across the Great Plains, eventually arriving in San Francisco, where he began his literary career. He published his first poem in 1867 and went on to contribute to various newspapers and periodicals, including \"The San Francisco News Letter,\" \"The Argonaut,\" and \"The Wasp.\" Bierce became a well-known figure in California literary society, befriending Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and Joaquin Miller.\n\nIn 1872, Bierce published his first book, \"The Fiend's Delight,\" under the pseudonym Dod Grile. He then moved to England with his wife, Mary Ellen \"Mollie\" Day, where he contributed to magazines such as \"Fun\" and \"Figaro.\" During this time, he published three books of sketches, earning him the nickname \"Bitter Bierce\" due to his cynical and sardonic wit.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, Bierce continued his career in journalism, eventually becoming one of the most prominent and influential writers on the West Coast. He joined William Randolph Hearst's \"San Francisco Examiner\" in 1887 and remained associated with Hearst Newspapers until 1909. Bierce's columns often stirred controversy due to his biting social criticism and satire. One of his most famous works, \"The Devil's Dictionary\" (1906), is a satirical lexicon that lampoons political double-talk and cant.\n\nBierce was also a prolific writer of short fiction, penning 249 short stories, 846 fables, and over 300 humorous \"Little Johnny\" stories. His most popular stories, written between 1888 and 1891, often highlighted the inscrutability of the universe and the absurdity of death, with a particular focus on his experiences in the Civil War. Bierce's grimly realistic war stories have been hailed as \"the greatest anti-war documents in American literature.\"\n\nIn addition to his satirical and supernatural works, Bierce also wrote poetry. He published two books of poetry, \"Black Beetles in Amber\" (1892) and \"Shapes of Clay\" (1903), which were later included in his \"Collected Works.\" Bierce's poetry, like his prose, often reflected his cynical outlook on life and his talent for sharp social critique.\n\nIn 1913, at the age of seventy-one, Bierce was drawn to the Mexican Revolution and decided to join Pancho Villa's army as an observer. He sent his last known letter from Chihuahua, Mexico, in December 1913, and then vanished without a trace, becoming one of the most famous disappearances in American literary history. The circumstances of his death remain a mystery.\n\nAmbrose Bierce's legacy is that of a master of dark humor, satire, and the supernatural. His works continue to influence writers and readers alike, and his mysterious disappearance only adds to the allure of his literary persona.

These songs emerged from diverse cultural traditions and oral histories, reflecting the experiences and perspectives of everyday people.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of American folk songs is their emphasis on storytelling. Whether through ballads, work songs, or tunes of protest and social change, these songs often narrate tales of love, hardship, humor, and resilience. The lyrics are often filled with vivid imagery and creative metaphors, capturing the essence of the human experience in a way that is accessible and relatable.\n\nThe melodies of American folk songs are equally captivating.

They have influenced literature, film, and art, inspiring countless creations that explore similar themes of the human condition.

It paints a picture of a place called Cripple Creek, known for its lively atmosphere and colorful characters. The song likely originated in the late 19th century and has since been recorded by numerous artists, each putting their own unique spin on it.\n\n\"Cripple Creek\" is a testament to the enduring appeal of American folk songs. It embodies the spirit of community, joy, and creativity that lies at the heart of this rich musical tradition, continuing to inspire and connect people from all walks of life.\n\nHere are some additional interesting facts about \"Cripple Creek\" and American folk songs:\n\n- Folk songs often contain elements of hyperbole and humor to entertain and engage listeners.\n- \"Cripple Creek\" is believed to refer to a real place in Colorado, which experienced a gold rush in the late 1800s, attracting a diverse range of people.\n- American folk songs have influenced various music genres, including country, blues, and rock and roll.\n- The lyrics and melodies of folk songs were often adapted and changed over time, reflecting the evolving nature of oral traditions.\n- Many folk songs address social issues and have been used as tools for activism and change. \n\nThe legacy of American folk songs is a testament to the power of storytelling and the ability of music to transcend boundaries, unite communities, and leave an indelible mark on our cultural landscape. \n\nSo, let's raise our voices and sing, for the story of American folk songs is one that deserves to be celebrated and kept alive for generations to come. \n",

She died of cancer in September 1994., Amy Clampitt was born and raised in New Providence, Iowa. She studied first at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, and later at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research in New York City. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Clampitt held various jobs at publishers and organizations such as Oxford University Press and the Audubon Society. In the 1960s, she turned her attention to poetry. In 1974 she published a small volume of poetry titled Multitudes, Multitudes; thereafter her work appeared frequently in the New Yorker. Upon the publication of her book of poems The Kingfisher in 1983, she became one of the most highly regarded poets in America. Her other collections include A Silence Opens&nbsp;(1994), Westward&nbsp;(1990), What the Light Was Like&nbsp;(1985),&nbsp;and&nbsp;Archaic Figure&nbsp;(1987). Clampitt received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Academy of American Poets. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Clampitt taught at the College of William and Mary, Amherst College, and Smith College.\r\n\r\nJoseph Parisi, a Chicago Tribune Book World reviewer, called the poet&rsquo;s sudden success after the publication of The Kingfisher &ldquo;one of the most stunning debuts in recent memory.&rdquo; Parisi continued, &ldquo;throughout this bountiful book, her wit, sensibility and stylish wordplay seldom disappoint.&rdquo; In one of the first articles to appear after The Kingfisher&rsquo;s debut, New York Review of Books critic Helen Vendler wrote that &ldquo;Amy Clampitt writes a beautiful, taxing poetry. In it, thinking uncoils and coils again, embodying its perpetua argument with itself.&rdquo; Georgia Review contributor Peter Stitt also felt that &ldquo;The Kingfisher is &hellip; in many ways an almost dazzling performance.&rdquo; In the Observer, Peter Porter described Clampitt as &ldquo;a virtuoso of the here and the palpable.&rdquo; Porter ranked her with the likes of Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Bishop.\r\n\r\nCritics praised the allusive richness and syntactical sophistication of Clampitt&rsquo;s verse. Her poetry is characterized by a &ldquo;baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon,&rdquo; said New York Times Book Review contributor Alfred Corn in an article about Clampitt&rsquo;s second important collection, What the Light Was Like (1985). Indeed, the poet&rsquo;s use of vocabulary and syntax is elaborate. &ldquo;When you read Amy Clampitt,&rdquo; suggests Richard Tillinghast in the New York Times Book Review, &ldquo;have a dictionary or two at your elbow.&rdquo; The poet has, Tillinghast continues, a &ldquo;virtuoso command of vocabulary, [a] gift for playing the English language like a musical instrument and [a] startling and delightful ability to create metaphor.&rdquo; Her ability as a poet quickly gained Clampitt recognition as &ldquo;the most refreshing new American poet to appear in many years,&rdquo; according to one Times Literary Supplement reviewer.\r\n\r\nClampitt&rsquo;s work is also characterized by erudite allusions, for which she provides detailed footnotes. Times Literary Supplement critic Lachlan Mackinnon compared her &ldquo;finical accuracy of description and the provision of copious notes at the end of a volume,&rdquo; to a similar tendency in the work of Marianne Moore. &ldquo;She is as &lsquo;literary&rsquo; and allusive as Eliot and Pound, as filled with grubby realia as William Carlos Williams, as ornamented as Wallace Stevens and as descriptive as Marianne Moore,&rdquo; observed Corn. Washington Post reviewer Joel Conarroe added Walt Whitman and Hart Crane to this list of comparable poets: &ldquo;Like Whitman, she is attracted to proliferating lists as well as to &lsquo;the old thought of likenesses,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote Conarroe. &ldquo;And as in Crane her compressed images create multiple resonances of sound and sense.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWhat the Light Was Like centers around images of light and darkness. This book is &ldquo;more chastely restrained than The Kingfisher,&rdquo; according to Times Literary Supplement contributor Neil Corcoran. Conarroe believed that the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;own imagery throughout [the book] is sensuous (even lush) and specific&mdash;in short, Keatsian.&rdquo; Corn similarly commented that &ldquo;there are stirring moments in each poem, and an authentic sense of Keats&rsquo; psychology.&rdquo; He opined, however, that &ldquo;her sequence [&lsquo;Voyages: A Homage to John Keats&lsquo;] isn&rsquo;t effective throughout, the reason no doubt being that her high-lyric mode&rdquo; does not suit narrative as well as a plainer style would.\r\n\r\nClampitt&rsquo;s Archaic Figure (1987) maintains her &ldquo;idiosyncratic style,&rdquo; as William Logan called it in the Chicago Tribune. New York Times Book Review contributor Mark Rudman noted the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;spontaneity and humor; she is quick to react, hasty, impulsive, responsive to place&mdash;and to space.&rdquo; In the London Sunday Times, David Profumo further praised Archaic Figure. Taking the example of the poem &ldquo;Hippocrene,&rdquo; the critic asserted that this work &ldquo;demonstrates her new powers of economy, the sureness of her rhythmic touch and the sheer readability of her magnificent narrative skills.&rdquo; &ldquo;Amy Clampitt,&rdquo; concluded Logan, &ldquo;has become one of our poetry&rsquo;s necessary imaginations.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nClampitt died in Lenox, Massachusetts in 1994., Amy Clampitt  (June 15, 1920 \u2013 September 10, 1994) was an  American poet  and author.

Her biography of Keats was published in 1925, the same year she won the Pulitzer Prize for her collection What's A Clock.\n\tA dedicated poet, publicity agent, collector, critic, and lecturer, Lowell died in 1925 at Sevenals.\n\t\u00a0, Amy Lowell was a poet, performer, editor, and translator who devoted her life to the cause of modern poetry. &ldquo;God made me a business woman,&rdquo; Lowell is reported to have quipped, &ldquo;and I made myself a poet.&rdquo; During a career that spanned just over a dozen years, she wrote and published over 650 poems, yet scholars cite Lowell&rsquo;s tireless efforts to awaken American readers to contemporary trends in poetry as her more influential contribution to literary history. She is best remembered for bringing the Imagism of Ezra Pound and H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) to the attention of Americans, but her work has many facets. A flamboyant woman whose behavior belied her upbringing in a proper and prestigious New England family, she flouted convention with her proto-feminist poetry and unabashedly public persona. &ldquo;Poet, propagandist, lecturer, translator, biographer, critic &hellip; her verve is almost as remarkable as her verse,&rdquo; opined poet Louis Untermeyer in his 1923 work American Poetry since 1900.\r\n\r\nLowell was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1874, into a prominent New England family&mdash;her brother, Percival Lowell, was a well-known astronomer, while another brother, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, became president of Harvard College. As a young girl she attended private schools in between sojourns to Europe with her family and, at the age of 17, began a diligent process of educating herself inside the seven thousand-volume library at Sevenels, the Lowell family seat in Brookline where she would also live as an adult. In August of 1910, at the age of 36, Lowell saw her first poem, &ldquo;Fixed Idea,&rdquo; published in the Atlantic. Other poems appeared regularly in various periodicals over the next several years.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, Lowell&rsquo;s first collection of poetry was published. A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass was, in many ways, highly conventional for its era. However, in the Dictionary of Literary Biography E. Claire Healey and Laura Ingram noted that &ldquo;Lowell&rsquo;s honesty of expression and an occasional brilliant image provided a glimpse of what was to come.&rdquo; Healey and Ingram also wrote appreciatively of the design of A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass, which Lowell had based on a volume by early 19th-century English poet John Keats. A devotee of Keats&rsquo;s work since her teenage years, Lowell gradually amassed a collection of the author&rsquo;s papers and manuscripts that she would later mine for a weighty biography.\r\n\r\nAfter beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her 30s, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art. One day in 1913, after reading a number of poems signed &ldquo;H.D., Imagiste,&rdquo; she realized that her own poetry followed in much the same literary vein. The new style of poetry she had just encountered was termed &ldquo;Imagism&rdquo; by its main proponent, Ezra Pound. Imagism borrowed from both English and American verse styles to create a new Anglo-American literary movement that &ldquo;honed poetic expression down to its purest, most direct form,&rdquo; explained Healey and Ingram in Dictionary of Literary Biography. Its practitioners&mdash;Pound, Ford Madox Ford, H.D., and Richard Aldington, among others&mdash;were divided between London and the United States and influenced by the general mood of modernism permeating the era prior to World War I.\r\n\r\nLowell journeyed to London with the goal of meeting with Pound; she carried with her a letter of introduction from Harriet Monroe, editor of the Chicago-based Poetry magazine. Lowell and Pound struck up a mutual friendship, and she also became acquainted with poet John Gould Fletcher and novelist Henry James; her trip also exposed her to other modernist trends in the performing and visual arts. Back in Boston, Lowell undertook a campaign to make Imagist poetry both a critical and financial success in the United States and began traveling often between the two countries. During one trip, in the summer of 1914, she became an unwitting player in the forming of factions among the Imagists, with Pound formally abandoning the movement (for a few years) and Lowell then taking up editorship of an annual anthology of Imagist poetry to which she had previously been a contributor. Anti-Pound factions among the writers believed that Pound&rsquo;s editorship of the anthology, as well as his general de facto leadership, exhibited too capricious a manner.\r\n\r\nLowell&rsquo;s editorship of these collections of Imagist poetry began in 1915 with Some Imagist Poets: An Anthology, to which she also contributed; two more volumes were published in subsequent years. In her introduction to the 1915 volume, Lowell attempted to set down some criteria for Imagist writers. They should strive, she wrote,\r\n\r\n1. To use the language of common speech &hellip;\r\n2. To create new rhythms &hellip;\r\n3. To allow absolute freedom in the choice of subject &hellip;\r\n4. To present an image &hellip;\r\n5. To produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.\r\n6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this era, Lowell was also writing poetry of her own and saw the publication of several volumes, including Sword Blades and Poppy Seed (1914), Can Grande&rsquo;s Castle (1918), and Pictures of the Floating World (1919). Lowell&rsquo;s own verse, highly influenced by her contact with the Imagists after 1913, headed toward what she termed &ldquo;unrhymed cadence,&rdquo; a non-metrical style she felt well-suited for the English language and based on the natural rhythms of speech. With her friend John Gould Fletcher, Lowell is credited with bringing this style, also called polyphonic prose, into American poetry, an art described by S. Foster Damon in Amy Lowell: A Chronicle as &ldquo;the most various and supple poetic form ever devised in English. It runs without let or hindrance from one rhythm into another, according to the mood of the moment; it allows the use of any and every device known to versification, the only restriction being that &lsquo;the sound should be an echo to the sense.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLowell continued to publish volumes of poetry over the next few years, but Legends (1921) would be the last collection of her own work published before her death. In it, she uses 11 legends from around the globe as a basis for 11 poems. William Lyon Phelps, reviewing the work for the New York Times Book Review, commended the growth Lowell had shown since her early days as a poet. &ldquo;There is simply no comparison in excellence between&rdquo; the stronger parts of Legends, Phelps wrote, &ldquo;and the best pages of her first book. While her chief forte is description, owing to her extraordinary sensitivity to sounds, colors, and smells, she has given in Legends such a variety of beauty as to delight her friends and to bewilder her enemies.&rdquo; John Livingston Lowes, writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, grouped Legends and Can Grande&rsquo;s Castle as among the more outstanding examples of Lowell&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;I know no writer of English whose command of the rich vocabulary of sensuous impressions approaches Amy Lowell&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the critic asserted. &ldquo;The almost physical impact of it startles one each time one turns her pages.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThroughout much of her career Lowell&rsquo;s curiosity and intellectual keenness took her farther than her New England upbringing and continental jaunts; through Pound she became interested and subsequently influenced by the cultures of East Asia. One scholar of her work, William Leonard Schwartz, noted that Lowell&rsquo;s poetry, especially after Pictures of the Floating World, could be compared with the rhythms in Japanese visual art. She also penned haiku poetry and what she called &ldquo;Chinoiseries,&rdquo; poems fashioned after the idiomatic languages of the East Asia. Taking her interests a step further, Lowell also reworked Chinese poems with translator Florence Ayscough for the collection Fir-Flower Tablets (1921). Some critics faulted what they felt were errors in the translations, but others praised the work: Saturday Review of Literature critic Lowes deemed the poems &ldquo;in their exquisite art, among the masterpieces of their kind.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn the early 1920s Lowell took a hiatus from the art and business of poetry to pen a biography on Keats. In John Keat&rsquo;s 1300 pages, she attempted to show why she felt the English writer, who died in 1821, was the spiritual forebear of Imagist poetry. Lowell&rsquo;s in-depth chronicle of Keats&rsquo;s short life was structured into a near day-to-day chronology, and through the wealth of Keats material she had amassed over the years her biography managed to clarify some issues about the poet&rsquo;s personal life. Some critics felt it a bit too lengthy&mdash;Leonard Woolf faulted Lowell for reconstructing scenes from Keats&rsquo;s life and manufacturing the inner thoughts that might have accompanied them. &ldquo;This is an ancient biographical convention which eventually wraps the reader&rsquo;s brain in coil upon coil of psychological conjecture,&rdquo; Woolf remarked in the Nation. Other critics praised its depth and tone. &ldquo;The biography as a whole showed remarkable insight into poetic psychology, such as was possible only for one poet writing on another,&rdquo; Damon wrote in Amy Lowell. However, Lowell&rsquo;s exhaustive scholarship into Keats had extracted a physical toll, including severe eyestrain. Winfield Townley Scott, writing in the New England Quarterly, declared that the tremendous effort she put into the biography &ldquo;certainly killed Amy Lowell.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLowell penned two books of literary criticism, Six French Poets: Studies in Contemporary Literature (1915) and Tendencies in Modern American Poetry (1917). Untermeyer, in American Poetry since 1900, praised the latter volume, noting &ldquo;it is her catholicity of taste, her subjugation of prejudices that make such a book not only a noble interpretation but a contribution to criticism.&rdquo; In her later years, despite increasingly poor health, Lowell continued to devote her energies to winning over the American public to an appreciation of contemporary poetry. She undertook lecture tours, and, more importantly, she used her social connections, financial independence, and forthright personality to boost the careers of other poets, providing feedback, recommending their work to others, acting as a liaison with editors, and writing articles on the subject. Carl Sandburg was one recipient of Lowell&rsquo;s support.\r\n\r\nLowell&rsquo;s A Critical Fable, published in 1922, was a literary answer to A Fable for Critics, an earlier work written by her cousin James Russell Lowell. It was a lighthearted satire on the literary currents of her day and the business of writing. Lowes, writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, termed it &ldquo;a tour de force of self-portraiture&mdash;or rather, a gay, sparkling, whimsical portrait of herself as she knew that others saw her.&rdquo; By 1920 Lowell had been engaged for several years in a relationship with her secretary, Ada Dwyer Russell, an association that some of her biographers note seemed to have provided the poet with emotional stability and happiness for perhaps the first time in her life. Lowell penned several romantic odes to Russell over the years, including &ldquo;The Temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anticipation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Taxi.&rdquo; Yet Lowell&rsquo;s health rapidly declined during the 1920s; a glandular condition had caused her to gain weight, and the excess poundage then brought its own health concerns. Hernia attacks were a particular problem, and in May of 1925 she suffered a serious one; two days later she rose from her bed against medical advice and was immediately felled by a stroke. She died within a few hours.\r\n\r\nAda Dwyer Russell edited a trio of posthumous collections of Lowell&rsquo;s verse, including What&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Clock &mdash;which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926&mdash;East Wind, and Ballads for Sale. In Dictionary of Literary Biography, Healey and Ingram termed Lowell &ldquo;the embodiment of the new liberated woman,&rdquo; expressly citing the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;unlimited faith in her own capability.&rdquo; Lowell&rsquo;s longtime colleague Harriet Monroe, editor of Poetry magazine, assessed her friend&rsquo;s career for Poets and Their Art. &ldquo;Her six volumes of verse and three of prose present, with singular completeness, a commanding&mdash;nay, enthralling&mdash;personality,&rdquo; Monroe declared of Lowell. &ldquo;Such energy, fecundity, persistence, intelligence, appearing in this world of compromises and half-successes, rebukes people less forceful less unified, by achieving to the very limit of its power.&rdquo;, Amy Lawrence Lowell  (February 9, 1874 \u2013 May 12, 1925) was an American poet of the  imagist  school, which promoted a return to classical values. She posthumously won the  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  in 1926.Amy Lowell was born on February 9, 1874, in  Boston , Massachusetts, the daughter of  Augustus Lowell  and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the  Brahmin   Lowell family , her siblings included the astronomer  Percival Lowell , the educator and legal scholar  Abbott Lawrence Lowell , and  Elizabeth Lowell Putnam , an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of  John Lowell  and, on their mother's side, the grandchildren of  Abbott Lawrence . [4] [5]School was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing \"masculine\" and \"ugly\" features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated. [6]Lowell never attended college because her family did not consider it proper for a woman to do so.  She compensated for this lack with avid reading and near-obsessive  book collecting . She lived as a socialite and travelled widely, turning to poetry in 1902 (aged 28) after being inspired by a performance of  Eleonora Duse  in Europe. After beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her 30s, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art. [7]Lowell was said to be  lesbian , and in 1912 she and actress  Ada Dwyer Russell  were reputed to be lovers. Russell is reputed to be the subject of Lowell's more erotic works, most notably the love poems contained in 'Two Speak Together', a subsection of  Pictures of the Floating World . The two women traveled to England together, where Lowell met  Ezra Pound , who at once became a major influence and a major critic of her work.  Pound considered Lowell's embrace of Imagism to be a kind of hijacking of the movement. Lowell has been linked romantically to writer  Mercedes de Acosta , but the only evidence of any contact between them is a brief correspondence about a planned memorial for Duse.Lowell was a short but imposing figure who kept her hair in a bun and wore a  pince-nez .Lowell publicly smoked cigars, as newspapers of the day frequently mentioned. [8]  A glandular problem kept her perpetually overweight. Poet  Witter Bynner  once said, in a comment frequently misattributed to  Ezra Pound , that she was a \"hippopoetess\". [9]  Her admirers defended her, however, even after her death. One rebuttal was written by  Heywood Broun  in his obituary tribute to Amy. He wrote, \"She was upon the surface of things a Lowell, a New Englander and a spinster. But inside everything was molten like the core of the earth ... Given one more gram of emotion, Amy Lowell would have burst into flame and been consumed to cinders.\" [10]Lowell died of a  cerebral hemorrhage  in 1925, at the age of 51 and is buried at  Mount Auburn Cemetery . [11]  The following year, she was awarded the  Pulitzer Prize for Poetry  for  What's O'Clock .  That collection included the patriotic poem \"Lilacs\", which  Louis Untermeyer  said was the poem of hers he liked best.Her first published work appeared in 1910 in  Atlantic Monthly . The first published collection of her poetry,  A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass , appeared two years later, in 1912. An additional group of uncollected poems was added to the volume  The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell , published in 1955 with an introduction by Untermeyer, who considered himself her friend.Though she sometimes wrote  sonnets , Lowell was an early adherent to the \" free verse \" method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to \"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\" in the  North American Review  for January 1917; in the closing chapter of \"Tendencies in Modern American Poetry\"; and also in  The Dial  (January 17, 1918), as:  \"The definition of  vers libre  is: a verse-formal based upon cadence.  To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed  cadence  is \"built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.  Free verse within its own law of  cadence  has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had.\" [12]Untermeyer writes that \"She was not only a disturber but an awakener.\" [13]  In many poems, Lowell dispenses with line breaks, so that the work looks like prose on the page. This technique she labeled \"polyphonic prose\". [14]Throughout her working life, Lowell was a promoter of both contemporary and historical poets. Her book  Fir-Flower Tablets  was a poetical re-working of literal translations of the works of ancient Chinese poets, notably  Li Tai-po  (701\u2013762).  Her writing also included critical works on French literature.  At the time of her death, she was attempting to complete her two-volume biography of  John Keats  (work on which had long been frustrated by the noncooperation of  F. Holland Day , whose private collection of Keatsiana included  Fanny Brawne 's letters to Frances Keats). Lowell wrote of Keats: \"the stigma of oddness is the price a myopic world always exacts of genius.\" [15]Lowell published not only her own work, but also that of other writers. According to Untermeyer, she \"captured\" the Imagist movement from  Ezra Pound .  Pound threatened to sue her for bringing out her three-volume series  Some Imagist Poets , and thereafter derisively called the American Imagists the \"Amygist\" movement. Pound criticized her as not an imagist, but merely a rich woman who was able to financially assist the publication of imagist poetry. She said that Imagism was weak before she took it up, whereas others said it became weak after Pound's \"exile\" towards  Vorticism .Lowell wrote at least two poems about libraries\u2014The \"Boston Athenaeum\" [16]  and \"The Congressional Library\" [17] \u2014during her career. A discussion of libraries also appears in her essay \"Poetry, Imagination, and Education\". [18]Lowell's partner Ada Dwyer Russell was the subject of many of Lowell's romantic poems, [19]  and Lowell wanted to dedicate her books to Russell, but Russell would not allow that, and relented only once for Lowell's biography of  John Keats , in which Lowell wrote, \"To A.D.R., This, and all my books. A.L.\" [20]  Examples of these love poems to Russell include  the Taxi ,  Absence ,  A Lady   [21] :\u200axxi\u200a   In a Garden ,  Madonna of the Evening Flowers , [22]   Opal , [23]  and  Aubade . [24]  Lowell admitted to  John Livingston Lowes  that Russell was the subject of her series of romantic poems titled \"Two Speak Together\". [25] [26]  Lowell's poems about Russell have been called the most explicit and elegant lesbian love poetry during the time between the ancient  Sappho  and poets of the 1970s. [24]  Most of the private correspondence in the form of romantic letters between the two were destroyed by Russell at Lowell's request, leaving much unknown about the details of their life together. [21] :\u200a47In the post- World War I  years, Lowell was largely forgotten, but the  women's movement  in the 1970s and  women's studies  brought her back to light. According to  Heywood Broun , however, Lowell personally argued against  feminism . [27]Additional sources of interest in Lowell today come from the  anti-war  sentiment of the oft-taught poem \"Patterns\"; her  personification  of inanimate objects, as in \"The Green Bowl\", and \"The Red Lacquer Music Stand\"; and her lesbian themes, including the love poems addressed to Ada Dwyer Russell in \"Two Speak Together\" and her poem \"The Sisters\", which addresses her female poetic predecessors.Lowell's correspondence with her friend  Florence Ayscough , a writer and translator of Chinese literature, was compiled and published by Ayscough's husband Professor  Harley Farnsworth MacNair  in 1945. [28].",
        "response": "\n**Amy Lowell: A Poet of Many Passions** \n\nAmy Lowell, born in 1874, was a poet, performer, editor, and translator who embodied the spirit of the early 20th century. With her flamboyant personality and unconventional lifestyle, she challenged societal norms and blazed a trail for women in the literary world. Growing up in a prominent New England family, Lowell received a privileged education and traveled extensively throughout Europe. However, it was her self-directed studies in her family's extensive library that ignited her passion for literature and poetry.\n\nLowell's first published poem, \"Fixed Idea,\" appeared in the prestigious *Atlantic Monthly* in 1910, marking the beginning of her literary career. Her early works, such as her first collection \"A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass\" (1912), showed glimpses of her unique style and honest expression. It was her encounter with the Imagist movement, however, that truly ignited her creative fire.\n\nThe Imagists, led by Ezra Pound, sought to create poetry that was \"hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.\" This philosophy resonated deeply with Lowell, who became a passionate advocate and practitioner of Imagism. She embraced the movement's principles in her own work, experimenting with free verse and what she called \"polyphonic prose,\" a style that mixed formal verse and free forms. Lowell's enthusiasm and influence were such that they contributed to Pound's eventual separation from the movement.\n\nAs Lowell continued to explore and promote Imagism, she also turned her attention to the poetry of East Asia. Collaborating with translator Florence Ayscough, she published \"Fir-Flower Tablets\" in 1921, a collection of re-worked Chinese poems. This interest in East Asian culture and poetry led her to study and appreciate the works of the ancient Chinese poet Li Tai-po.\n\nAnother significant influence on Lowell's life and work was her lifelong love for the poet John Keats. She collected his letters and manuscripts, and her extensive biography of Keats, published in 1925, revealed her deep insight into the poetic psyche. Lowell believed that Keats was a forerunner of Imagism, and her dedication to his legacy is evident in her own poetry.\n\nIn addition to her poetic endeavors, Lowell was a dedicated publicity agent, collector, critic, and lecturer. She used her social connections, financial independence, and dynamic personality to support and promote the work of other poets, including Carl Sandburg. Her tireless efforts to bring contemporary poetry to the attention of American readers are considered her most influential contribution to literary history.\n\nLowell's health declined in the 1920s due to a glandular condition and related health issues. Despite her physical challenges, she continued to write and publish, with her final collection, \"Legends\" (1921), showcasing her poetic maturity and mastery of sensuous imagery. On May 12, 1925, Lowell passed away at the age of 51, leaving behind a rich legacy of poetry and literary contributions.\n\nIn 1926, Lowell was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for her collection \"What's O'Clock.\" This recognition solidified her place in the canon of American poetry and ensured that her passionate and innovative voice would continue to inspire future generations of poets and readers alike.",

You may redistribute it, verbatim or modified, under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License., Poet Andrew Hudgins was born in Killeen, Texas, in 1951. The eldest son in a military family, Hudgins moved around the American South for much of his childhood, eventually attending Huntingdon College and the University of Alabama. He earned his MFA from the Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop in 1983. His poetry is known for its dark humor, formal control, and adept handling of voice. Hudgins&rsquo;s first book, Saints and Strangers (1986), was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize; his third collection, The Never-Ending (1991), was a finalist for the National Book Award. Commended by critics for his striking ability to embody the Southern Gothic tradition of American literature, Hudgins&rsquo;s early poems swell with sanguinary images of guilt, sacrifice, and powerlessness. Other early books such as After the Lost War: A Narrative (1988), a series of dramatic monologues recounting the life of Georgia poet and Confederate soldier Sidney Lanier, and The Glass Hammer: A Southern Childhood (1994) also use the conventions of Southern literary tradition to delve into the narrative potential of biography and autobiography. Hudgins himself has spoken of his desire to write poems he himself would like to read, and critic Jordan Davis has argued that The Glass Hammer is one of the best verse-autobiographies of the last few decades because of the attention Hudgins pays to the fashioning of self: &ldquo;most writers forget that I is a character,&rdquo; Davis wrote in The Constant Critic, &ldquo;and that the special relationship between the writer and this character does not relieve the writer of the obligation to tell the reader something worth hearing. Hudgins remembers this obligation clearly in The Glass Hammer.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHudgins&rsquo;s collection of essays, The Glass Anvil (1997), explores childhood, memory, and personal poetics in prose. Of his tendency to take on project-length works, Hudgins has said he enjoys their self-sustaining quality, and for the unique kind of inspiration they foster: &ldquo;I do believe that immersing ourselves in a project allows our brains to work on them without our conscious effort. So I have made a rule for myself that if an idea flashes through my head in those moments before sleep, I will get up and write it down. A lot of incoherent notes&mdash;or notes that are merely obvious or dumb&mdash;get pitched in the morning, but that twilight of consciousness often enough permits good ideas to flit around in the shadows. My deal with my subconscious is that if it permits me to glimpse those shadows I will take them seriously by getting up and recording what I see, even if it costs me a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTypically a narrative poet whose dependence on persona and dramatic monologue extend into later collections such as Shut Up You&rsquo;re Fine: Poems for Very, Very Bad Children (2009), Hudgins has also attempted more lyrical modes in volumes like Ecstatic in the Poison: New Poems (2003). Describing the collection, poet Mark Strand alleged, &ldquo;Dark moments seem charged with an eerie luminosity and the most humdrum events assume a startling lyric intensity. A deep resonant humor is everywhere, and everywhere amazing.&rdquo; American Rendering: New and Selected Poems (2010) contains two dozen new poems that take on a range of familiar themes&mdash;including a religious tension that has marked much of Hudgins&rsquo;s work. Jordan Davis noted that in his latest work Hudgins &ldquo;appears to be pulling together all his powers, dramatic self-interruption, intense physicality, good-natured almost immature mischief, and a charming impatience that wears a lot better with experience. More importantly, he is turning all his energies toward life as well as death, toward uncertain conclusions as often as foregone ones.&rdquo; Hudgins has ascribed his frequent use of humor to a similar understanding of uncertainty. In an interview with The Pedestal Magazine, he said, &ldquo;Humor is a complex and often dirty business. As the ancient playwrights knew, everything depends on where the Wheel of Fortune stops, or more accurately, pauses, hesitates, or trembles, before it starts spinning again. Emerson: &lsquo;Every end is prospective of some other end, which is also temporary.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHudgins&rsquo;s many awards include the Hanes Poetry Prize and the Witter Bynner Award for Poetry.

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Due to the inconsistencies and ambiguities within his work and the scarcity of information about his personal life, Andrew Marvell has been a source of fascination for scholars and readers since his work found recognition in the early decades of the twentieth century. Born on March 31, 1621, Marvell grew up in the Yorkshire town of Hull, England, where his father, Rev. Andrew Marvell, was a lecturer at Holy Trinity Church and master of the Charterhouse. At age twelve Marvell began his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. Four years later, two of Marvell\u2019s poems, one in Latin and one in Greek, were published in an anthology of Cambridge poets. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1639, Marvell stayed on at Trinity, apparently to complete a master\u2019s degree. In 1641, however, his father drowned in the Hull estuary and Marvell abandoned his studies. During the 1640s Marvell traveled extensively on the continent, adding Dutch, French, Spanish, and Italian to his Latin and Greek\u2014missing the English Civil Wars entirely.Marvell spent most of the 1650s working as a tutor, first for Mary Fairfax, daughter of a retired Cromwellian general, then for one of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s wards. Scholars believe that Marvell\u2019s greatest lyrics were written during this time. In 1657, due to John Milton\u2019s\u00a0efforts on his behalf, Marvell was appointed Milton\u2019s Latin secretary, a post Marvell held until his election to Parliament in 1660.A well-known politician, Marvell held office in Cromwell\u2019s government and represented Hull to Parliament during the Restoration. His very public position\u2014in a time of tremendous political turmoil and upheaval\u2014almost certainly led Marvell away from publication. No faction escaped Marvell\u2019s satirical eye; he criticized and lampooned both the court and Parliament. Indeed, had they been published during his lifetime, many of Marvell's more famous poems\u2014in particular, \u201cTom May's Death,\u201d an attack on the famous Cromwellian\u2014would have made him rather unpopular with royalists and republicans alike.Marvell used his political status to free Milton, who was jailed during the Restoration, and quite possibly saved the elder poet\u2019s life. In the early years of his tenure, Marvell made two extraordinary diplomatic journeys: to Holland (1662\u201363) and to Russia, Sweden, and Denmark (1663\u201365). In 1678, after eighteen years in Parliament, Marvell died rather suddenly of a fever. Gossip from the time suggested that the Jesuits (a target of Marvell\u2019s satire) had poisoned him. After his death, he was remembered as a fierce and loyal patriot.Now considered one of the greatest poets of the seventeenth century, Marvell published very little of his scathing political satire and complex lyric verse in his lifetime. Although he published a handful of poems in anthologies, a collection of his work did not appear until 1681, three years after his death, when his nephew compiled and found a publisher for Miscellaneous Poems. The circumstances surrounding the publication of the volume aroused some suspicion: a person named \u201cMary Marvell,\u201d who claimed to be Marvell\u2019s wife, wrote the preface to the book. \u201cMary Marvell\u201d was, in fact, Mary Palmer\u2014Marvell\u2019s housekeeper\u2014who posed as Marvell\u2019s wife, apparently, in order to keep Marvell\u2019s small estate from the creditors of his business partners. Her ruse, of course, merely contributes to the mystery that surrounds the life of this great poet.Andrew Marvell died on August 16, 1678.Wallace Stevens was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on October 2, 1879. He attended Harvard University as an undergraduate from 1897 to 1900.Born in 1899 in Brooklyn, New York, L\u00e9onie Adams graduated from Barnard College in 1922.The author of numerous works, Marie Ponsot won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her collection The Bird Catcher\u00a0(Alfred A. Knopf, 1998). She served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2010 to 2014.Born in 1886, Hilda Doolittle was one of the leaders of the Imagist movement. She published numerous poetry collections, including\u00a0Sea Garden (Constable and Company, 1916) and\u00a0Helen in Egypt (Grove Press, 1961). She died in 1961.Henry Vaughan was born on April 17, 1622, in\u00a0Llansantffraed, Breconshire, Wales.The poet John Donne is known as the founder of the Metaphysical Poets, which included George Herbert and Andrew Marvell, among others., \r\n\tAndrew Marvell [1621-1678] was an English metaphysical poet and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1659 and 1678. As a metaphysical poet, he is associated with John Donne and George Herbert. He was a colleague and friend of John Milton. His poems include 'To His Coy Mistress', 'The Garden', 'An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland', 'The Mower's Song' and the country house poem 'Upon Appleton House'.\r\n\tOne of the English \"Metaphysical Poets\". Educated in Cambridge, he worked as a clerk, traveled abroad, and returned to serve as tutor to Lord Fairfax's daughter in Yorkshire.\u00a0 In 1657 he was appointed John Milton's assistant in the Latin secretaryship, and in 1659 he was elected to Parliament, where he served until his death in 1678.\r\n\tHe was one of the chief wits and satirists of his time as well as being a Puritan and a public defender of individual liberty. Today, however, he is known chiefly for his brilliant lyric poetry, which includes \u201cThe Garden,\u201d \u201cThe Definition of Love,\u201d \u201cBermudas,\u201d and \u201cTo His Coy Mistress,\u201d and for his \u201cHoratian Ode\u201d to Cromwell., Andrew Marvell is surely the single most compelling embodiment of the change that came over English society and letters in the course of the 17th century. In an era that makes a better claim than most upon the familiar term transitional, Marvell wrote a varied array of exquisite lyrics that blend Cavalier grace with Metaphysical wit and complexity. He first turned into a panegyrist for the Lord Protector and his regime and then into an increasingly bitter satirist and polemicist, attacking the royal court and the established church in both prose and verse. It is as if the most delicate and elusive of butterflies somehow metamorphosed into a caterpillar.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the judgment of Marvell&rsquo;s contemporaries and the next few generations would not have been such. The style of the lyrics that have been so prized in the 20th century was already out of fashion by the time of his death, but he was a pioneer in the kind of political verse satire that would be perfected by his younger contemporary John Dryden and in the next generation by Alexander Pope (both writing for the other side)&mdash;even as his satirical prose anticipated the achievement of Jonathan Swift in that vein. Marvell&rsquo;s satires won him a reputation in his own day and preserved his memory beyond the 18th century as a patriotic political writer&mdash;a clever and courageous enemy of court corruption and a defender of religious and political liberty and the rights of Parliament. It was only in the 19th century that his lyrical poems began to attract serious attention, and it was not until T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s classic essay (first published in March 1921), marking the tercentenary of Marvell&rsquo;s birth, that Marvell attained recognition as one of the major lyric poets of his age.\r\n\r\nIn recent years postmodernist theory has once again focused on Marvell as a political writer, but with as much attention to the politics of the lyric poems as to the overtly partisan satires. Doubtless what sustains critical interest in Marvell and accommodates the enormous quantity of interpretive commentary attracted by his work is the extraordinary range and ambiguity of theme and tone among a comparatively small number of poems. Equally uncertain are the nature and timing of his personal involvement and his commitments in the great national events that occurred during his lifetime. Nevertheless, despite the equivocal status of many of the details of Marvell&rsquo;s life and career, the overall direction is clear enough: he is a fitting symbol for England&rsquo;s transformation in the 17th century from what was still largely a medieval, Christian culture into a modern, secular society. In his subtle, ironic, and sometimes mysterious lyrics, apparently written just at the middle of the century, we have one of our finest records of an acute, sensitive mind confronting the myriad implications of that transformation.\r\n\r\nThe son of the Reverend Andrew Marvell and Anne Pease Marvell, Andrew Marvell spent his boyhood in the Yorkshire town of Hull, where his father, a clergyman of Calvinist inclination, was appointed lecturer at Holy Trinity Church and master of the Charterhouse when the poet was three years old. His father was, Marvell wrote years later in The Rehearsal Transpros&rsquo;d: The Second Part (1673), &ldquo;a Conformist to the established Rites of the Church of England, though I confess none of the most over-running or eager in them.&rdquo; Not surprisingly then, at the age of twelve in 1633, Marvell was sent up to Trinity College, Cambridge. This was the very year that William Laud became archbishop of Canterbury. If not such a stronghold of Puritanism as Emmanuel College (alma mater of Marvell&rsquo;s father), Trinity was characterized by a moderation that contrasted sharply with a college such as Peterhouse (Richard Crashaw&lsquo;s college), which ardently embraced the Arminianism and ritualism of the Laudian program. Indeed, the liberal, rationalistic tenor of Marvell&rsquo;s religious utterances in later life may owe something to the influence of Benjamin Whichcote, who in 1636 as lecturer at Trinity Church began to lay the foundation for the latitudinarian strain that was so important in the Church of England after the Restoration. Such tenuous evidence as exists, however, does not suggest Puritan enthusiasm on the part of the youthful poet. The story that Marvell, converted by Jesuits, ran away from Cambridge and was persuaded to return by his father, who found him in a London bookshop, has never been properly verified (although embarrassment over such a youthful indiscretion might go far to explain the virulent anti-Catholicism of his later years). More provocative is the lack of any evidence that he participated in the English Civil War, which broke out a few months after his twenty-first birthday, and the Royalist tone of his poems before 1650.\r\n\r\nMarvell&rsquo;s earliest surviving verses lead to no conclusions about his religion and politics as a student. In 1637 two pieces of his, one in Latin and one in Greek, were published in a collection of verses by Cambridge poets in honor of the birth of a fifth child to Charles I. Other contributors were as diverse as Richard Crashaw, who would later be a Catholic priest, and Edward King, whose death by drowning that same year was the occasion for John Milton&rsquo;s Lycidas (1638). Marvell&rsquo;s Latin poem, &ldquo;Ad Regem Carolum Parodia,&rdquo; is a &ldquo;parody&rdquo; in the sense that it is a close imitation&mdash;in meter, structure, and language&mdash;of Horace, Odes I.2. While the Roman poet hails Caesar Augustus as a savior of the state in the wake of violent weather and the flooding of the Tiber, Marvell celebrates the fertility of the reigning sovereign and his queen on the heels of the plague that struck Cambridge at the end of 1636. Marvell&rsquo;s contribution in Greek asserts that the birth of the king&rsquo;s fifth child had redeemed the number five, of ill omen since attempts had been made on the life of James I on August 5, 1600 and November 5, 1605. It would be easy enough to condemn the poem&rsquo;s frigid ingenuity but for a reluctance to be harsh with the work of a 16-year-old capable of writing Latin and Greek verse.\r\n\r\nIf little can be made of these student exercises, the poems written in the 1640s that imply a close association between Marvell and certain Royalists furnish intriguing (if meager) grounds for speculation. The mystery is further complicated by a lack of evidence regarding Marvell&rsquo;s whereabouts and activities during most of the decade. In 1639 he earned his BA and stayed on at the university, evidently to pursue a MA degree. In 1641, however, his father drowned in &ldquo;the Tide of Humber&rdquo;&mdash;the estuary at Hull made famous by &ldquo;To his Coy Mistress.&rdquo; Shortly afterward Marvell left Cambridge, and there is plausible speculation that he might have worked for a time in the shipping business of his well-to-do brother-in-law, Edmund Popple. It is known that sometime during the 1640s Marvell undertook an extended tour of the Continent. In a letter of February 21, 1653 recommending Marvell for a place in his own department in Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s government, Milton credits Marvell with four years&rsquo; travel in Holland, France, Italy, and Spain, where he acquired the languages of all four countries. Regrettably Milton casts no light upon the motives and circumstances of this journey. Modern scholarship has generally assumed that Marvell served as the companion/tutor of a wealthy and perhaps noble youth, but all the candidates brought forward for this role have been eliminated by one consideration or another. Some have suggested that Marvell was merely avoiding the war, others that he was some kind of government agent. Although the explanation that he was a tutor seems most plausible, there is no certainty about what he was doing.\r\n\r\nWhatever the purpose of his travel, its lasting effects turn up at various points in Marvell&rsquo;s writings. The burlesque &ldquo;Character of Holland&rdquo; (1665), for example, draws on reminiscences of the dikes of the Netherlands: &ldquo;How did they rivet, with Gigantick Piles, / Thorough the Center their new-catched Miles.&rdquo; &ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo; describes a drained meadow by evoking a Spanish arena &ldquo;Ere the Bulls enter at Madril,&rdquo; and a letter &ldquo;To a Friend in Persia&rdquo; recalls fencing lessons in Spain (August 9, 1671). The circumstantial detail of &ldquo;Fleckno, an English Priest at Rome,&rdquo; a satire very much in the manner of John Donne&rsquo;s efforts in that genre, suggests that Marvell actually met the victim of his poem in Rome when Richard Flecknoe was there in 1645-1647. Flecknoe is, of course, the man immortalized as Thomas Shadwell&rsquo;s predecessor as king of dullness in John Dryden&rsquo;s Mac Flecknoe (1682). Marvell mercilessly ridicules both the poverty of Flecknoe&rsquo;s wit and his literal poverty and consequent leanness. The jokes at the expense of Catholic doctrine seem almost incidental to the abuse of Flecknoe&rsquo;s undernourished penury:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNothing now Dinner stay&rsquo;d\r\nBut till he had himself a Body made.\r\nI mean till he were drest: for else so thin\r\nHe stands, as if he only fed had been\r\nWith consecrated Wafers: and the Host\r\nHath sure more flesh and blood than he can boast.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these lines play irreverently with the Thomist teaching that the Body and Blood of Christ are both totally contained under each of the eucharistic species, as well as with accounts of the life of Saint Catherine of Siena, who is said to have subsisted for several years with no other nourishment than daily Communion. But the real object of this quasi-Scholastic wit (again, much in the style of Donne) is the absurdity of Flecknoe, and it lacks the virulent loathing that characterizes Marvell&rsquo;s attack on the doctrine of Transubstantiation years later in An Account of the Growth of Popery (1677). His mockery of the narrowness of Flecknoe&rsquo;s room makes a similar joke with the doctrine of the Trinity, which was accepted by virtually all Protestants at the time:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there can no Body pass\r\nExcept by penetration hither, where\r\nTwo make a crowd, nor can three Person here\r\nConsist but in one substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the jocular anti-Catholicism of &ldquo;Fleck-no&rdquo; hardly implies militant Puritanism, by placing Marvell in Rome between 1645 and 1647, it raises the possibility that he met Lord Francis Villiers, who was also in Rome in 1645 and 1646. This would strengthen the case for Marvell&rsquo;s authorship of &ldquo;An Elegy upon the Death of my Lord Francis Villiers&rdquo; and bring to three the number of Royalist poems that he wrote. Two poems published in 1649, Richard Lovelace and &ldquo;Upon the death of Lord Hastings,&rdquo; are both indisputably by Marvell and indisputably Royalist in sentiment. It is not simply that both poems celebrate known adherents of the king&rsquo;s failed cause, but that they do so with pungent references to the triumphant side in the Civil War. The death of Henry, Lord Hastings, in 1649 at the age of 19 may have resulted immediately from smallpox, but the ultimate source of his fate is that &ldquo;the Democratick Stars did rise, / And all that Worth from hence did Ostracize.&rdquo; The poem to Lovelace is one of the commendatory pieces in the first edition of Lucasta (1649). Marvell observes how &ldquo;Our Civill Wars have lost the Civicke crowne&rdquo; and refers with explicit scorn to the difficulty encountered in acquiring a printing license for the volume:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe barbed Censurers begin to looke\r\nLike the grim consistory on thy Booke;\r\nAnd on each line cast a reforming eye,\r\nSeverer then the yong Presbytery.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent lines Marvell refers to Lovelace&rsquo;s legal difficulties with Parliament, especially his imprisonment for presenting the Kentish petition requesting control of the militia and the use of the Book of Common Prayer.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;An Elegy upon the Death of my Lord Francis Villiers&rdquo; was first published in the H.M. Margoliouth edition (1927) from an apparently unique pamphlet left to the Worcester College Library by George Clarke (1660-1736) with an ascription of the poem to Marvell in Clarke&rsquo;s hand. Villiers (1629-1648), posthumous son of the assassinated royal favorite George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, died in a skirmish against Parliamentary forces. Here the poet celebrates not just a Royalist, but a Royalist killed in military action against the revolutionary government. &ldquo;Fame&rdquo; had &ldquo;Much rather&rdquo; told &ldquo;How heavy Cromwell gnasht the earth and fell. / Or how slow Death farre from the sight of day / The long-deceived Fairfax bore away.&rdquo; Villiers is credited with erecting &ldquo;A whole Pyramid / Of Vulgar bodies,&rdquo; and the poet recommends that those who lament him turn to military rather than literary &ldquo;Obsequies&rdquo;:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd we hereafter to his honour will\r\nNot write so many, but so many kill.\r\nTill the whole Army by just vengeance come\r\nTo be at once his Trophee and his Tombe.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence suggests that Clarke was a reliable witness; there is nothing in the style of the poem that rules out Marvell as the author; and, though more extreme politically, it is certainly compatible in sentiment and tone with the Hastings elegy and the commendatory poem for Lucasta, which Marvell is known to have written about the same time. If the Villiers elegy is in fact Marvell&rsquo;s, then it casts a rather eerie light on the man who would the following year write &ldquo;An Horatian Ode upon Cromwel&rsquo;s Return from Ireland&rdquo; and in 1651 become tutor to the daughter of Thomas, third Baron Fairfax.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; is undoubtedly one of the most provocatively equivocal poems in English literature. It has been read both as a straightforward encomium of Cromwell and as an ironic deprecation. There is plentiful evidence for both extremes as well as for intermediate positions. Interpretations are only more confused by the fact that the poem can be narrowly dated. Its occasion is the return of Oliver Cromwell from one of the more brutally successful of the many British efforts to &ldquo;pacify&rdquo; the Irish, at the end of May 1650. It anticipates his invasion of Scotland, which occurred on July 22, 1650. During the interval Thomas, Lord Fairfax, already unhappy about the execution of King Charles, resigned his position as commander in chief of the Parliamentary army because he disapproved of striking the first blow against the Scots. His lieutenant general, Cromwell, was appointed in his place and proceeded with the attack. Little is known about Marvell&rsquo;s footing with the Royalists whom he honored with poems in 1649 or with his Puritan employers, Fairfax beginning in 1651 and later Cromwell himself; hence it is futile to infer the attitude of the 1650 ode from the sketchy biographical facts.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWhatever was in Marvell&rsquo;s mind at the time, the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; succeeds in expressing with surpassing finesse and subtlety a studied ambivalence of feeling sharply bridled by the decisive grasping of a particular point of view. Written near the exact midpoint of the century and very nearly in the middle of the poet&rsquo;s 57 years, the ode on Cromwell establishes its portentous subject as a paradigmatic figure of the great transformation of English culture then unfolding&mdash;as both a cause and effect of the final dissolution of the feudal order of medieval Christendom. The argument of the ode, which shares something of the driving energy of the &ldquo;forward Youth&rdquo; and of &ldquo;restless Cromwel&rdquo; himself, is almost completely devoted to the exaltation of the victorious general as a man in whom a relentless individual will to power and an inevitable historical necessity have converged to refashion the world. Cromwell is described both as conscious, deliberating agent and as an ineluctable force of nature:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo restless Cromwel could not cease\r\nIn the inglorious Arts of Peace,\r\nBut through adventrous War\r\nUrged his active Star.\r\nAnd, like the three-fork&rsquo;d Lightning, first\r\nBreaking the Clouds where it was nurst,\r\nDid through his own Side\r\nHis fiery way divide.\r\n\r\nHe is exonerated for the violence and destruction of his campaigns because he is the instrument of divine wrath, but he is also given credit for character, courage, and craftiness:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lsquo;Tis Madness to resist or blame\r\nThe force of angry Heavens flame:\r\nAnd, if we would speak true,\r\nMuch to the Man is due.\r\n\r\nMarvell accepts the contemporary rumor that Cromwell deliberately engineered Charles&rsquo;s flight from Hampton Court, by &ldquo;twining subtile fears with hope,&rdquo; so that after the king&rsquo;s recapture his loss of crown and head was more likely; but the device is adduced not to exemplify Cromwell&rsquo;s malice, but his &ldquo;wiser Art.&rdquo; Cromwell is thus the rehabilitation of Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli. Even the closing stanzas, while asserting the continued necessity of military force to maintain the regime, in no way condemn it. Writing in the year before Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan (1651), Marvell has come independently to the same conclusion, that power is essentially its own justification:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut thou the Wars and Fortunes Son\r\nMarch indefatigably on;\r\nAnd for the last effect\r\nStill keep thy Sword erect:\r\nBesides the force it has to fright\r\nThe Spirits of the shady Night,\r\nThe same Arts that did gain\r\nA Pow&rsquo;r must it maintain.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Marvell means that Cromwell is to keep his &ldquo;Sword erect&rdquo; by keeping the blade up, ready to strike; but the assertion that it would thus &ldquo;fright / The Spirits of the shady Night,&rdquo; notwithstanding precedents in Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey and Virgil&rsquo;s Aeneid, still calls to mind the opposite procedure: holding up the hilt as a representation of the cross. By implicitly rejecting the cross as an instrument of political power, Marvell obliquely indicates that one effect of the vast cultural revolution set in motion by the Civil War was the banishing of religion from political life, just one aspect of the general secularization of Western civilization already under way at the time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOf course what distinguishes the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; is the emotional shudder that pervades it, acknowledging the wrenching destructiveness of massive social change. Marvell concedes that Charles I, in some sense, has right on his side, but he will not concede that the right, or justice, is an inviolable absolute to which a man must remain unshakably committed. A terrible exhilaration marks the stanza in which the &ldquo;ruine&rdquo; of &ldquo;the great Work of Time&rdquo; is regretted but unblinkingly accepted:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThough Justice against Fate complain,\r\nAnd plead the antient Rights in vain:\r\nBut those do hold or break\r\nAs Men are strong or weak.\r\n\r\nThere is a finely calculated irony in the way &ldquo;the Royal Actor&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Tragick Scaffold&rdquo; occupies the very center of an ode dedicated to Cromwell&rsquo;s victories and furnishes the poem&rsquo;s most memorable lines:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe nothing common did or mean\r\nUpon that memorable Scene:\r\nBut with his keener Eye\r\nThe Axes edge did try:\r\nNor call&rsquo;d the Gods with vulgar spight\r\nTo vindicate his helpless Right,\r\nBut bow&rsquo;d his comely Head,\r\nDown as upon a Bed.\r\n\r\nThese lines are moving, and they seem to reflect Marvell&rsquo;s genuine admiration for the king as well as a vivid realization that some ineffable cultural value was lost irrecoverably with Charles&rsquo;s head, but nostalgia for what was passing away is subsumed in the excited awareness of the advent of what was new: &ldquo;This was that memorable Hour / Which first assur&rsquo;d the forced Pow&rsquo;r.&rdquo; The word forced is not pejorative here; force is, finally, the hero of the poem even more than the individual Cromwell.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe brilliant ambivalence of feeling is enhanced by Marvell&rsquo;s deft deployment of classical precedents. The obvious Horatian model is Odes I.37, a celebration of Augustus&rsquo;s naval victory at Actium that closes with a tribute to Cleopatra&rsquo;s courage in committing suicide rather than facing the humiliation of a Roman triumph. In addition, Marvell has drawn upon the language and imagery of Lucan&rsquo;s Pharsalia, both in the original and in Thomas May&rsquo;s English translation. That Marvell&rsquo;s language describing Cromwell is mainly borrowed from Lucan&rsquo;s descriptions of Caesar (whom Lucan detested) is not an encoded condemnation of the English general; it is an aspect of Marvell&rsquo;s strategy for praising Cromwell not merely in spite of, but because of, qualities that are conventionally condemned. The point of the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; is that Cromwell has ushered in a new era that renders &ldquo;the antient Rights&rdquo; obsolete.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGiven the radical character of the &ldquo;Horatian Ode,&rdquo; it is actually easier to account for the apparent anomaly of Marvell&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Tom May&rsquo;s Death.&rdquo; May, who died on November 13, 1650 and whose translation of Lucan seems to have influenced some passages of the &ldquo;Horatian Ode,&rdquo; had made his reputation as a poet at the court of Charles I and apparently hoped to succeed Ben Jonson as poet laureate upon Jonson&rsquo;s death in 1637. According to his enemies&mdash;including the author of &ldquo;Tom May&rsquo;s Death&rdquo;&mdash;it was chagrin at having been passed over in favor of William Davenant that led May to switch sides and became a propagandist for Parliament. In the major action of the poem the shade of Ben Jonson, in &ldquo;supream command&rdquo; of the Elysian Fields of poets, expels May from their number for &ldquo;Apostatizing from our Arts and us, / To turn the Chronicler of Spartacus.&rdquo; Critics have wondered how the same man who celebrated Cromwell in the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; could only a few months later scornfully equate the Parliamentary rebellion against the king with the revolt of Roman slaves under Spartacus, or depict the two best-known regicides of the classical world thus: &ldquo;But how a double headed Vulture Eats, / Brutus and Cassius the Peoples cheats.&rdquo; What Marvell may well be doing in this poem is simply distancing himself from May, who seems to have been a loutish individual (according to contemporary accounts he died in a drunken stupor) and whose political choices seemed to have been determined by sheer expediency as well as personal pique. His death perhaps afforded Marvell an opportunity to deal with residual Royalist sentiment in conflict with his judgment and even to assure himself that his own changing allegiances were not motivated by venality. Given the ambiguity of Marvell&rsquo;s politics in 1650, it is not reasonable to exclude a poem from the canon because it seems politically incompatible with another poem. It is also difficult to deny Marvell lines such as these:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen the Sword glitters ore the Judges head,\r\nAnd fear has Coward Churchmen silenced,\r\nThen is the Poets time, &lsquo;tis then he drawes,\r\nAnd single fights forsaken Vertues cause.\r\nHe, when the wheel of Empire, whirleth back,\r\nAnd though the World&rsquo;s disjointed Axel crack,\r\nSings still of ancient Rights and better Times,\r\nSeeks wretched good, arraigns successful Crimes.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means displeasing to think that Marvell had second thoughts about his dismissal of the &ldquo;antient Rights&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Horatian Ode.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nPerhaps before the end of 1650, but certainly by 1651, Marvell was employed as tutor in languages to the twelve-year-old daughter of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, who had returned to his Yorkshire estates after resigning his military command. It is not known who recommended Marvell for the post, but doubtless his own Yorkshire background was a factor. Marvell remained with Fairfax until early 1653 when he sought employment in the Cromwell government with John Milton&rsquo;s recommendation. Instead Cromwell procured Marvell a position as tutor to William Dutton, who was being considered as a husband for Cromwell&rsquo;s youngest daughter, Frances. Marvell served as Dutton&rsquo;s tutor until 1657, living in the house of John Oxenbridge, a Puritan divine who had spent time in Bermuda to escape Laud&rsquo;s reign over the Church of England. In 1657 Marvell did receive a government post with Milton as his supervisor. The period of the poet&rsquo;s employment as a tutor is generally thought to be the time when his greatest lyrics and topographical poems&mdash;the works on which his twentieth-century reputation is founded&mdash;were written.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly having their source in Marvell&rsquo;s sojourn with Fairfax are three poems on the general&rsquo;s properties at Bilbrough and Nun Appleton: &ldquo;Epigramma in Duos montes Amosclivum Et Bilboreum. Farfacio,&rdquo; &ldquo;Upon the Hill and Grove at Bill-borow To the Lord Fairfax,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upon Appleton House, to my Lord Fairfax.&rdquo; The first two of these poems, the Latin epigram and its English companion piece, allegorize topographical features in and around the Fairfax manor at Bilbrough to praise the character of Marvell&rsquo;s patron. The Latin poem attributes to Fairfax both the forbidding ruggedness of Almscliff and the gentleness of the hill at Bilbrough: &ldquo;Asper in adversos, facilis cedentibus idem&rdquo; (the same man is harsh to enemies, easy on those who yield); while the English poem elaborates upon the agreeable qualities of Bilbrough as an emblem of the man who modestly withdrew from &ldquo;his own Brightness&rdquo; as a military leader to a life of rural retirement. &ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo; takes up the theme and develops it through nearly 800 lines into a subtle and complex meditation on the moral implications of choosing a life of private introspection over action, of withdrawal from the world rather than involvement in its affairs. Beginning as a country-house poem in the mode of Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;To Penshurst,&rdquo; Marvell&rsquo;s poem expands into a leisurely survey of the entire landscape that moves with an ease that is the antithesis of the urgency of the &ldquo;Horation Ode.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo; covers an array of topics with an extraordinary range of wit and tone, but its central preoccupation is the identical theme of the ode on Cromwell, only in reverse: while that poem gives an exhilarating account of the career of Cromwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;active Star,&rdquo; moderated by a keen sense of the violence of &ldquo;the three-fork&rsquo;d Lightning,&rdquo; the poem on Fairfax expresses a deep affection as well as respect for its hero, tempered by just a hint that Fairfax&rsquo;s scruples and modesty may have been excessive and detrimental to his country. Marvell comments on the incongruity between the floral ordinance of Nun Appleton&rsquo;s fort-shaped flower beds and the actual warfare that had laid England waste; then he suggests that, had Fairfax&rsquo;s conscience been less tender, it might have been within his power to set England right:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd yet their walks one on the Sod\r\nWho, had it pleased him and God,\r\nMight once have made our Gardens spring\r\nFresh as his own and flourishing.\r\nBut he preferr&rsquo;d to the Cinque Ports\r\nThese five imaginary Forts:\r\nAnd, in those half-dry Trenches, spann&rsquo;d\r\nPow&rsquo;r which the Ocean might command.\r\n\r\nThe fine discrimination of these lines defies comment: Is there an intimation, however slight, that preference for &ldquo;imaginary Forts&rdquo; is not worthy of a man of Fairfax&rsquo;s gifts during a national crisis? But even to suggest this much is to suggest too much: it is never put in doubt that Fairfax is listening to his conscience; that is, to God. While there is regret that the best man is impeded by his very goodness from assuming the position for which he is fitted, there is no recrimination; the sorrow is, finally, a result of the inherent condition of fallen mankind:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOh Thou, that dear and happy Isle\r\nThe Garden of the World ere while,\r\nThou Paradise of four Seas,\r\nWhich Heaven planted us to please,\r\nBut, to exclude the World, did guard\r\nWith watry if not flaming Sword;\r\nWhat luckless Apple did we tast,\r\nTo make us Mortal, and The Wast?\r\n\r\nIf Fairfax himself has succeeded in withdrawing from the world&mdash;now become &ldquo;a rude heap together hurled&rdquo;&mdash;into the &ldquo;lesser World&rdquo; of Nun Appleton, &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Center, Nature&rsquo;s Lap. / And Paradice&rsquo;s only Map,&rdquo; his daughter must go out into that world in marriage to carry on &ldquo;beyond her Sex the line.&rdquo; Always the individual hope of happy retirement is threatened by the historical necessity of society:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhence, for some universal good,\r\nThe Priest shall cut the sacred Bud;\r\nWhile her glad Parents most rejoice,\r\nAnd make their Destiny their Choice\r\n\r\nWe can only wonder how Marvell responded to the marriage of his former pupil when it came in 1657, and Maria Fairfax was joined with George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, elder brother of Lord Francis Villiers, and one of the most notorious rakes of the notorious Restoration era. Such a &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; may have shaken even the poet&rsquo;s cool detachment.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMany of Marvell&rsquo;s best-known lyrics are associated with his tenure as Maria Fairfax&rsquo;s tutor because they deploy language and themes that appear in &ldquo;Upon Appleton House.&rdquo; The Mower poems, for example, provide a particular focus on the undifferentiated figures of the mowing section of &ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo; (lines 385-440). Four in number, the Mower poems are a variant of the pastoral mode, substituting a mower for the familiar figure of the shepherd (as Jacopo Sannazaro&rsquo;s Piscatorial Eclogues [1526] substitutes fishermen). &ldquo;The Mower against Gardens&rdquo; is the complaint of a mower against the very idea of the formal enclosed garden planted with exotic hybrids&mdash;an increasingly fashionable feature of English country estates in the 17th century, condemned by the mower as a perverted and &ldquo;luxurious&rdquo; tampering with nature at her &ldquo;most plain and pure.&rdquo; The theme is unusual, if not unprecedented, with the most familiar treatment coming in Perdita&rsquo;s argument with Polixenes in William Shakespeare&rsquo;s The Winter&rsquo;s Tale (IV.4). As is so often the case in Marvell&rsquo;s poems, the point is stated in its most extreme form by his censorious mower: it is not just excess that offends him, the &ldquo;Onion root [tulip bulb] they then so high did hold, / That one was for a Meadow sold&rdquo;; but the very notion of the luxuriant, ornamental garden as an improvement over nature: &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis all enforc&rsquo;d; the Fountain and the Grot; / While the sweet Fields do lye forgot.&rdquo; The poem is thus pervaded by hints of timely references to the revolutionary situation of England at mid-century: the mower&rsquo;s strictures against formal gardens recall the Puritan&rsquo;s suspicion of religious images and courtly extravagance, the laboring man&rsquo;s bitter disdain for the self-indulgent idleness of his social &ldquo;betters,&rdquo; and the whole vexed issue of land enclosures. Yet these are overtones not arguments, and the single-minded moralizing of the mower is certainly not in the poet&rsquo;s own style, although a part of his nature would doubtless sympathize with the mower&rsquo;s &ldquo;root-and-branch&rdquo; viewpoint.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe other three Mower poems, &ldquo;Damon the Mower,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Mower to the Glo-Worms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mower&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; all express Damon&rsquo;s frustration at his rejection by a certain &ldquo;fair Shepheardess,&rdquo; Juliana. It cannot be determined whether Damon is to be identified with the speaker of &ldquo;The Mower against Gardens,&rdquo; but the voice in all the Mower poems displays the belligerent intensity of wounded self-righteousness. &ldquo;Damon the Mower&rdquo; is in a line of pastoral figures beginning with the Polyphemus of Theocritus (Idylls 11) and Ovid (Metamorphoses 13) and the Corydon of Virgil (Eclogues 2), all of whom enumerate their clownishly rustic wealth and personal attributes with incredulous frustration at the beloved&rsquo;s refusal to respond favorably to their advances. In keeping with the classical precedents, Marvell tempers the lugubriousness of his unhappy mower by endowing him with a certain threatening aura. In &ldquo;Damon the Mower&rdquo; the frantic activity of the lovesick laborer results in &ldquo;Depopulating all the Ground&rdquo; as he &ldquo;does cut / Each stroke between the Earth and Root.&rdquo; When he inadvertently cuts his own ankle, he is solemnly mocked with the line &ldquo;By his own Sythe, the Mower mown&rdquo;; but Damon dismisses this wound as inconsequential compared to that given by &ldquo;Julianas Eyes,&rdquo; and the poem closes with a sinister reminder of the symbolism of the Mower: &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis death alone that this must do: / For Death thou art a Mower too.&rdquo; Similarly, in &ldquo;The Mower&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; his obsessive fixation on desire disdained is expressed in a grim refrain, the only one in Marvell&rsquo;s verse, closing out all five stanzas: &ldquo;For Juliana comes, and She / What I do to the Grass, does to my Thoughts and Me.&rdquo; Even &ldquo;The Mower to the Glo-Worms&rdquo; leaves its disconsolate speaker benighted despite the friendly efforts of the fireflies, &ldquo;For She my Mind hath so displac&rsquo;d / That I shall never find my home.&rdquo; There are undoubtedly political resonances in the vociferous mower&mdash;sprung out of the soil, brandishing his scythe, and denouncing wealthy gardeners and shepherds and scornful shepherdesses&mdash;but his menacing air is blended with a larger measure of absurd pathos. The Mower poems are thus characteristic of Marvell&rsquo;s aloof irony.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The Garden&ldquo; shares in this equivocal detachment, as the endless debates about its sources (in classical antiquity, the church fathers, the Middle Ages, hermeticism, and so on), its relation to contemporary poetry, and its own ultimate significance show. The poem has been regarded as an account of mystical ecstasy by some commentators, of Horatian Epicureanism by others; some find in it an antilibertine version of the poetry of rural retirement, while others interpret it in terms of &ldquo;the politics of landscape.&rdquo; What seems indisputable is its congruence with the vision of reality proposed by the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo;: a virtually unbridgeable chasm is seen between contented withdrawal into contemplation and the actual life of man in the world. Ostensibly a celebration of the contemplative garden, hinting equally at the Garden of Eden and the enclosed garden of the Song of Songs, and the garden of the mind of classical philosophy, &ldquo;The Garden&ldquo; subverts the solemnity of the meditative theme by engulfing it in irony. The dismissal of the active life, of ambition or love, in the first four stanzas is stated in terms of absurd hyperbole: the strenuous efforts of politicians, soldiers, and even poets are disparaged because they result, at best, in only the &ldquo;short and narrow verged Shade&rdquo; of a single wreath, &ldquo;While all Flow&rsquo;rs and all Trees do close / To weave the Garlands of repose.&rdquo; Similarly, the &ldquo;lovely green&rdquo; of &ldquo;am&rsquo;rous&rdquo; plants is preferred to the conventional red and white of the Petrarchan mistress&rsquo;s complexion; and Apollo and Pan are supposed to have pursued Daphne and Syrinx not for the sake of their feminine charms, but for the laurel and reed into which the nymphs were transformed. The wit of these first four stanzas is highlighted by the labored elaboration of the same conceits in the Latin version of the poem, &ldquo;Hortus,&rdquo; which lacks any lines corresponding to stanzas 5-8 of &ldquo;The Garden.&rdquo; Sharply contrasted to, but never wholly free of, this foolery is the stunning depiction of &ldquo;The Mind&rdquo; and its transcendent activity, &ldquo;Annihilating all that&rsquo;s made / To a green Thought in a green Shade.&rdquo; But this introspective solitude can be known only as a longed-for impossibility by the self-conscious intelligence that defines itself in relation to the Other:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSuch was that happy Garden-state,\r\nWhile Man there walk&rsquo;d without a Mate:\r\nAfter a Place so pure, and sweet,\r\nWhat other Help could yet be meet!\r\nBut &lsquo;twas beyond a Mortal&rsquo;s share\r\nTo wander solitary there:\r\nTwo Paradises &lsquo;twere in one\r\nTo live in Paradise alone.\r\n\r\nThe speaker&rsquo;s petulant misogyny expresses at a deeper level a loathing for the social nature of the human condition, which creates the longing for total withdrawal into contemplative solitude and also renders it impossible.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The Nymph complaining for the death of her Faun&rdquo; posits the dichotomy in even starker terms: retirement into the innocence of nature, epitomized by a sublimely exquisite beast, is disrupted by warfare, that most violent manifestation of social conflict. Whether the &ldquo;wanton Troopers riding by,&rdquo; who have slain the fawn belong to Prince Rupert&rsquo;s Royalist forces, to the Scotch covenanting army of 1640, or to Cromwell&rsquo;s New Model Army is finally irrelevant to their significance in the poem. They personify the turbulent strife of the world outside the garden of contemplative withdrawal that, on this occasion, they have invaded. The casual indifference with which they kill the fawn aligns them with the Cromwell of the &ldquo;Horatian Ode&rdquo; who, as &ldquo;The force of angry Heavens flame,&rdquo; wreaks indiscriminate havoc. Similarly, the Nymph and the fawn are attractive but ineffectual figures, much like the King Charles of the &ldquo;Ode.&rdquo; The Nymph, in contrast to Isabel Thwaites and Maria Fairfax of &ldquo;Upon Appleton House,&rdquo; attempts to maintain a life of perpetual virginity and solitude, already disillusioned by &ldquo;Unconstant Sylvio&rdquo; before the advent of the &ldquo;Ungentle men&rdquo; who kill the fawn. At the center of the poem is the dying fawn itself. Swathed in a web of allusions to the Song of Songs and Virgil, as well as to other scriptural and classical passages, the fawn has been regarded as a symbol for Christ or the Church of England, or a surrogatus amoris for the deceived Nymph. The ambiguity of the fawn&rsquo;s significance does not, however, obscure the meaning of the poem; it is the meaning of the poem. In the 70 years since, it has not been better expressed than in T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s tercentenary essay: &ldquo;Marvell takes a slight affair, the feeling of a girl for her pet, and gives it a connection with that inexhaustible and terrible nebula of emotion which surrounds all our exact and practical passions and mingles with them.&rdquo; Of course, in surrounding the &ldquo;slight affair&rdquo; of personal emotion with a panoply of traditional references with mystical overtones, Marvell anticipated the enhanced role of subjective experience in the modern world and manifested a poignant awareness of the alienation of the private individual from the public objective realm.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAlienation is likewise the keynote of Marvell&rsquo;s love poems, which frequently elaborate the treatment of love in &ldquo;Upon Appleton House,&rdquo; where William Fairfax wins Isabel Thwaites by force, wresting her away from the nuns, and Maria Fairfax&rsquo;s marriage is anticipated as a ritual sacrifice. &ldquo;Young Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Picture of little T.C. in a Prospect of Flowers&rdquo; both take up a theme which originates in the Greek Anthology and proceeds through Horace to several 17th-century poets, including Thomas Randolph and Thomas Carew, before Marvell. What is striking in Marvell&rsquo;s poems is a certain ominousness: both girls are reminded that they may perish before their mature charms become threatening to men, and it is the threat of their growing beauty that leads the poet to seek peace before he is stricken. The application to a little girl of the full Petrarchan topos of the woman who murders by a combination of beauty and disdain, as in these lines from &ldquo;The Picture of little T.C.,&rdquo; borders on grotesquery:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nO then let me in time compound,\r\nAnd parly with those conquering Eyes;\r\nEre they have try&rsquo;d their force to wound,\r\nEre, with their glancing wheels, they drive\r\nIn Triumph over Hearts that strive,\r\nAnd them that yield but more despise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war of the sexes is similarly depicted in &ldquo;The Fair Singer&ldquo;; here the object of the poet&rsquo;s desire adds to the advantage of her captivating eyes the charms of an exquisite singing voice, which combine to defeat all his resistance conceived in martial terms: &ldquo;And all my Forces needs must be undone, / She having gained both the Wind and Sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Match&rdquo; portrays the beauties of one Celia as the storehouse of Nature&rsquo;s vitality, the poet as the conflagration of Love&rsquo;s powder magazine in her presence; and in &ldquo;The Gallery&ldquo; the poet&rsquo;s soul is a portrait gallery containing pictures only of Clora in an endless variety of guises and poses. She is both &ldquo;Enchantress&rdquo; and &ldquo;Murtheress,&rdquo; both Aurora and Venus. The poet confesses that he prefers the painting &ldquo;at the Entrance&rdquo; where she appears as a shepherdess, &ldquo;with which I first was took&rdquo;; but of course the point is that this &ldquo;Posture,&rdquo; like all the rest, is just a pose, a disguise&mdash;the real &ldquo;Clora&rdquo; cannot be finally identified, and certainly not relied upon.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe negative view of love suggested by these heightened Petrarchan conceits is intensified by two poems which blend tragic despair with an ingenious baroque extravagance. &ldquo;The unfortunate Lover&rdquo; deploys a series of emblematic images of the lover as a gallantly embattled knight of despair, born by &ldquo;a Cesarian Section&rdquo; to a woman shipwrecked on rocky shoals. The state of the lover is likened to the torment of Tityrus in hell (in Lucretius&rsquo;s De rerum natura). Cormorants &ldquo;fed him up with Hopes and Air, / Which soon digested to Despair.&rdquo; Hence the birds both nurture and consume him: &ldquo;And as one Corm&rsquo;rant fed him, still / Another on his Heart did bill.&rdquo; The lover thus exists in a condition of endlessly frustrated hope. The heraldic image at the poem&rsquo;s close suggests that the lover&rsquo;s tormented dissatisfaction makes him the hero only of romantic stories, but that such hopeless love is valuable not in reality, but only in romance:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYet dying leaves a Perfume here,\r\nAnd Musick within every Ear:\r\nAnd he in Story only rules,\r\nIn a Field Sablea Lover Gules.\r\n\r\nThese lines are reminiscent of the Charles I of the &ldquo;Horatian Ode,&rdquo; who is a &ldquo;Royal Actor&rdquo; upon the &ldquo;Tragick Scaffold&rdquo; but not really fit to rule.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The Definition of Love&rdquo; depicts the hopelessness of love in geometric terms. The lovers are like opposite poles of the globe, enviously separated by Fate&rsquo;s &ldquo;Decrees of Steel&rdquo;; to consummate this love would require the destruction of the world: &ldquo;And, us to joyn, the World should all / Be cramp&rsquo;d into a Planisphere.&rdquo; It is the very perfection of such love that renders impossible its temporal and physical realization:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs Lines so Loves obliquemay well\r\nThemselves in every Angle greet:\r\nBut ours so truly Paralel,\r\nThough infinite can never meet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to fateful, despairing passion would seem to be cynicism. In &ldquo;Daphnis and Chloe&rdquo; the latter, whom nature &ldquo;long had taught ... to be coy,&rdquo; offers to yield when Daphnis announces that he has given over his suit and will depart forever. Daphnis refuses this desperate offer for several high-sounding reasons, but the penultimate stanza reveals that his real motive is casual cruelty: &ldquo;Last night he with Phlogis slept; / This night for Dorinda kept; / And but rid to take the Air.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe masculine assault upon the reluctance of the &ldquo;coy&rdquo; woman lies at the heart of Marvell&rsquo;s best-known love poem&mdash;perhaps the most famous &ldquo;persuasion to love&rdquo; or carpe diem poem in English&mdash;&rdquo;To his Coy Mistress.&rdquo; Everything we know about Marvell&rsquo;s poetry should warn us to beware of taking its exhortation to carnality at face value. Critics from T. S. Eliot on took note of the poem&rsquo;s &ldquo;logical&rdquo; structure, but then it began to be noticed that the conditional syllogism in that structure is invalid&mdash;a textbook case of affirming the consequent or the fallacy of the converse. Has Marvell made an error? Or does he attribute an error to the speaking persona of the poem? Or is the fallacy part of the sophistry that a seducer uses on an ingenuous young woman? Or is it a supersubtle compliment to a woman expected to recognize and laugh at the fallacy? These alternatives must be judged in the light of the abrupt shifts in tone among the three verse paragraphs. In the opening lines the seducer assumes a pose of disdainful insouciance with his extravagant parody of the Petrarchan blason:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn hundred years should go to praise\r\nThine Eyes, and on thy Forehead Gaze.\r\nTwo hundred to adore each Breast:\r\nBut thirty thousand to the rest.\r\nAn Age at least to every part,\r\nAnd the last Age should show your Heart.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lady is said to &ldquo;deserve this State,&rdquo; the compliment is more than a little diminished when the speaker adds that he simply lacks the time for such elaborate wooing. It is also likely that most women would be put off rather than tempted by the charnel-house imagery of the poem&rsquo;s middle section where the seducer, sounding like a fire-and-brimstone preacher, warns that &ldquo;Worms shall try / That long preserv&rsquo;d Virginity.&rdquo; Finally, the depiction of sexual intimacy at the poem&rsquo;s close, with its vision of the lovers as &ldquo;am&rsquo;rous birds of prey&rdquo; who will &ldquo;tear our Pleasures with rough strife,&rdquo; is again a disconcerting image in an ostensible seduction poem. The persona&rsquo;s desire for the reluctant Lady is mingled with revulsion at the prospect of mortality and fleshly decay, and he manifests an ambivalence toward sexual love that is pervasive in Marvell&rsquo;s poetry.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMarvell&rsquo;s poems of religious inclination are few in number and so equivocal in status that one critic, J.B. Leishman, puts &ldquo;religious&rdquo; in quotation marks. The first problem is to decide which pieces in the Marvell canon count as religious poems. &ldquo;Clorinda and Damon&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Dorinda&rdquo; are both pastorals with quasi-religious overtones. In the first of these Damon has met &ldquo;Pan&rdquo; (pastoral jargon for Jesus, as Good Shepherd) and loftily informs Clorinda that he will no longer wanton with her in &ldquo;that unfrequented Cave,&rdquo; which she calls &ldquo;Loves Shrine&rdquo; but which to him is now &ldquo;Virtue&rsquo;s Grave.&rdquo; Clorinda is easily (too easily?) convinced to join Damon in praising &ldquo;Pan&rdquo; in place of wanton frolic. In &ldquo;A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Dorinda,&rdquo; Dorinda is so enraptured by her religious vision (of &ldquo;Elizium&rdquo;) that she persuades Thyrsis to enter into a suicide pact with her so they can reach &ldquo;Elizium&rdquo; as quickly as possible. Insofar as these dialogues touch on religious themes, they might be taken as sardonic parodies of Richard Crashaw&rsquo;s pastoral Nativity hymn, which also includes a shepherd named Thyrsis and concludes with the shepherds offering to burn as a sacrifice in the fiery eyes of the Christ Child. &ldquo;Eyes and Tears&rdquo; could similarly be taken as a not altogether pious imitation of Crashaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Weeper.&rdquo; Only the eighth stanza of Marvell&rsquo;s poem, a translation of his own Latin epigram on Mary Magdalene, makes an explicitly Christian reference. &ldquo;Eyes and Tears&rdquo; employs the baroque extravagance of &ldquo;The Weeper&rdquo; without Crashaw&rsquo;s devotional intensity.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;A Dialogue, Between The Resolved Soul, and Created Pleasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Dialogue between the Soul and Body&rdquo; are essentially philosophical in tone and substance although the former does make glancing allusion to the Pauline &ldquo;whole armor of God&rdquo; (Eph. 6:13-17) and the delight of &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; in the soul&rsquo;s triumphant resistance to the temptation of worldly pleasure. The soul/body dialogue makes no expressly Christian references and, contrary to the usual fashion of such poems, shows the body getting the better of the argument and undercutting the aloof smugness of the &ldquo;Resolved Soul&rdquo;:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat but a Soul could have the wit\r\nTo build me up for Sin so fit?\r\nSo Architects do square and hew,\r\nGreen Trees that in the Forest grew.\r\n\r\nBy the same token &ldquo;On a Drop of Dew,&rdquo; for all its perfect meditative form, is more Neoplatonic than Christian in mood, and this is equally true of its Latin companion piece, &ldquo;Ros.&rdquo; Both poems deploy the similitude of an evaporating drop of dew for the soul &ldquo;dissolving&rdquo; back into its natural home, &ldquo;the Glories of th&rsquo;Almighty Sun,&rdquo; and only a further comparison to evaporating manna provides a scriptural reference.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Bermudas&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Coronet&rdquo; of all Marvell&rsquo;s poems most resolutely develop Christian themes. The former doubtless dates from the time Marvell spent as a tutor to William Dutton in the Eton home of John Oxenbridge, who had sought refuge in Bermuda during Laud&rsquo;s persecution of Puritans. In part the poem is polemical: in Bermuda the psalm-singing English boatmen are &ldquo;Safe from the Storms, and Prelat&rsquo;s rage&rdquo;; but mainly it develops a vision of an earthly paradise as symbol for that withdrawal from the workaday world that is Marvell&rsquo;s constant preoccupation. The remote island is a garden spot of contemplative retirement, and its imagery is reminiscent of &ldquo;The Garden&rdquo;: &ldquo;He hangs in shades the Orange bright, / Like golden Lamps in a green Night.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Coronet&rdquo; is perhaps the most witheringly self-conscious poem of a poet of studied self-consciousness. Written in the tradition of John Donne&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Corona&rdquo; and George Herbert&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Wreath,&rdquo; Marvell&rsquo;s effort at repentance by weaving &ldquo;So rich a Chaplet ... / As never yet the king of Glory wore&rdquo; can be said almost to &ldquo;deconstruct&rdquo; the devotional tradition that it invokes. &ldquo;Dismantling all the fragrant Towers / That once adorn&rsquo;d my Shepherdesses head&rdquo; in order to weave a garland for Christ is clearly a figure for sacred parody&mdash;application of the tropes and themes of profane love poetry to devotional poetry. Marvell finds the whole procedure, central to the religious verse of the 17th century, flawed by an inevitable lack of purity of intention or of sincerity. The result is implicitly idolatry, the worship of our own devices and desires:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlas I find the Serpent old\r\nThat, twining in his speckled breast,\r\nAbout the flow&rsquo;rs disguis&rsquo;d does fold,\r\nWith wreaths of Fame and Interest.\r\n\r\nHence in a sophisticated manner, Marvell shares the Puritan suspicion of any ritual worship as not only inadequate but unworthy to express true devotion to God. Religious gesture and image (and perhaps the religious poem) must be destroyed to destroy the devil lurking within: &ldquo;Or shatter too with him my curious frame: / And let these wither, so that he may die, / Though set with Skill and chosen out with Care.&rdquo; Thus is Puritanism a recipe for secularization: since there can be no fitting or innocent expression of religious feeling, religion must remain silent; and art and culture are left to what is profane.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDuring the years that Marvell served as tutor to Dutton, Cromwell&rsquo;s virtual ward, the poet evidently came to be on intimate footing with the Lord Protector. Toward the end of 1654 Marvell commemorated The First Anniversary of the Government under O.C. in more than two hundred heroic couplets. The poem was published in quarto early in the following year by Thomas Newcomb, the government printer. The praise here is considerably less equivocal than in the &ldquo;Horatian Ode,&rdquo; but even so scholars have debated the ultimate intention of The First Anniversary. Is it a simple panegyric, a deliberative poem urging Cromwell to legitimate and solidify his power by having himself crowned king (the thesis of John M. Wallace), or an apocalyptic poem that celebrates Cromwell as the herald and architect of a new order of things? The last seems by far most probable, since Marvell pointedly contrasts Cromwell with &ldquo;Unhappy Princes, ignorantly bred, / By Malice some, by Errour more misled,&rdquo; who fail to recognize &ldquo;Angelique Cromwell&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; under whom they might pursue &ldquo;The Great Designes kept for the latter Dayes!&rdquo; The greatest design in which the subordinate monarchs should join the Protector is, evidently, the destruction of the Catholic church, &ldquo;Which shrinking to her Roman Den impure, / Gnashes her Goary teeth; nor there secure.&rdquo; Indeed, this poem, with its apocalyptic overtones, is the first sample of the virulent anti-Catholicism which will become central to Marvell&rsquo;s post-Restoration politics. He approaches the prophecy that Cromwell is the harbinger of the Millennium, but draws back into a cautious uncertainty: &ldquo;That &lsquo;tis the most which we determine can, / If these the Times, then this must be the Man.&rdquo; What The First Anniversary leaves us with, finally, is a sense of the fragility of the regime that depended so much on one man, whose mortality was so pointedly signaled by his potentially fatal Hyde Park coach accident in September 1654, a central incident in the poem.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn 1657 Marvell was appointed Latin secretary, the post for which Milton had recommended him four years earlier, and wrote two different though equally public poems: &ldquo;On the Victory Obtained by Blake over the Spaniards in the Bay of Santacruze, in the Island of Teneriff. 1657&rdquo; and &ldquo;Two Songs at the Marriage of the Lord Fauconberg and the Lady Mary Cromwell.&rdquo; The following year Cromwell died, and Marvell celebrated the late Lord Protector in A Poem upon the Death of O.C. Although the closing lines of this poem seem to proffer allegiance to Oliver&rsquo;s son, Richard Cromwell, who succeeded to his father&rsquo;s place, when Richard&rsquo;s government failed and he fled the country, the poet was a member of the Parliament that restored Charles II to the throne his father had lost. Elected member of Parliament for Hull in 1659, a position he held until the end of his life, Marvell was safe himself in the wake of the Restoration and well placed to help other members of the Interregnum government, including Milton, whose life he may well have saved.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nApart from two diplomatic journeys in the service of Charles Howard, Earl of Carlisle, in Holland (1662-1663) and in Russia, Sweden, and Denmark (1663-1665), Marvell remained generally in London, faithfully and energetically representing his Hull constituency of middle-class merchants. Naturally he became increasingly disenchanted with and alienated from the court of Charles II, who resorted to secret subsidies from Louis XIV and high-handed taxation measures to circumvent Parliament&rsquo;s reluctance to support his pro-French foreign policy and toleration of Catholicism. The most charming of Marvell&rsquo;s poems of this period is &ldquo;On Mr. Milton&rsquo;s Paradise lost,&rdquo; first published in the second edition of Milton&rsquo;s great epic (1674). Better than anyone else, Marvell expresses the wonder that most readers have felt upon perusing Milton&rsquo;s work: &ldquo;Where couldst thou Words of such a compass find? / Whence furnish such a vast expense of Mind?&rdquo; Otherwise, Marvell&rsquo;s Restoration poetry is almost exclusively confined to political satire of an extremely topical bent. With these poems questions of text and authenticity of attribution are extremely vexed. During an age of severe censorship, such fierce attacks upon the government could be published or circulated only anonymously; while still alive Marvell could not safely claim authorship, and after his death a poem gained immediate currency if attributed to the renowned patriot, whether he actually wrote it or not. Among the satires that Marvell certainly wrote, the most important are &ldquo;Clarindon&rsquo;s House-Warming,&rdquo; &ldquo;The last Instructions to a Painter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Loyall Scot.&rdquo; Reasonable arguments can also be made for &ldquo;The Kings Vowes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Statue in the Stocks-Market,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Statue at Charing Cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Dialogue between the Two Horses,&rdquo; and one or two other minor satires. George deF. Lord argues vigorously for the inclusion in the Marvell canon of the second and third &ldquo;Advice to a Painter&rdquo; poems, but his contention has not been widely accepted.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Clarindon&rsquo;s House-Warming&rdquo; reverses the architectural symbolism of &ldquo;Upon Appleton House&rdquo; by attacking the character of Henry Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, the king&rsquo;s chief minister, through ridicule of the ostentatious and very expensive house he built between 1664 and 1667, a time when London was suffering from the combined effects of fire, plague, and unsuccessful war with the Dutch. &ldquo;The last Instructions to a Painter&rdquo; is one of several satirical burlesques of Edmund Waller&rsquo;s panegyric on a naval victory commanded by the king&rsquo;s brother, James, Duke of York, titled Instructions to a Painter, For the Drawing of the Posture and Progress of His Majesties Forces at Sea (1666). Running to almost one thousand lines, &ldquo;The last Instructions to a Painter&rdquo; is the longest poem Marvell wrote. Although not infrequently enlivened by flashes of wit and intensity that anticipate the satires of Dryden and Pope, on the whole it lacks the clarity and universal appeal of Dryden&rsquo;s Absalom and Achitophel (1681) or Pope&rsquo;s Dunciad (1728, 1742). Perhaps the most effective of Marvell&rsquo;s satires is The Loyall Scot, which purports to be a recantation by the ghost of John Cleveland of his Royalist anti-Presbyterian satire, The Rebel Scot (1644). Marvell&rsquo;s satire on the ineptitude of the Royal Navy in an encounter with the Dutch under Michiel Adriaanszoon de Ruyter (1667) is highlighted by contrast with the heroic death of the Scottish captain Archibald Douglas. In lines that also appear in &ldquo;The last Instructions to a Painter,&rdquo; Marvell captures the young Scot&rsquo;s fiery death with the baroque intensity of his earlier manner:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLike a glad lover the fierce Flames he meets\r\nAnd tries his first Imbraces in their sheets.\r\nHis shape Exact which the bright flames enfold\r\nLike the sun&rsquo;s Statue stands of burnisht Gold:\r\nRound the Transparent fire about him Glowes\r\nAs the Clear Amber on the bee doth Close;\r\nAnd as on Angells head their Glories shine\r\nHis burning Locks Adorn his face divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarvell also wrote satires in prose, which are generally more successful in themselves while providing a model, in this case, for the prose of Jonathan Swift. Of these the best are surely the two parts of The Rehearsal Transpros&rsquo;d (1672, 1673), in which Marvell takes on the Reverend Samuel Parker, an erstwhile Puritan turned intolerant Tory Anglican, who recommended severe persecution of Protestant dissenters from the established church. The title of Marvell&rsquo;s work comes from George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s farcical mockery of Dryden&rsquo;s poetry, The Rehearsal (1672), and it engages in the same sort of high-spirited, if scurrilous, mockery in religious controversy that Buckingham had introduced into a literary quarrel. For once Marvell found himself, superficially at least, in agreement with the king, who had just issued the short-lived Declaration of Indulgence, which removed criminal penalties against Protestant dissenters and Catholic recusants alike. Charles, however, was mainly interested in protecting the recusants, and Marvell had sympathy only for the dissenters, so the marriage of convenience did not last long. Marvell continued his attack on Anglican intolerance in Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode, which was published with his Historical Essay on General Councils (1676), and he is probably the author of Remarks Upon a Late Disingenuous Discourse (1678), which defends the independent nonconformist John Howe from the strictures of a severe Calvinist dissenter, Thomas Danson. Finally, just before his death, Marvell produced An Account of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Government in England (1677), which blends shrewd insights into the devious machinations of the government of Charles II in circumventing Parliament with Marvell&rsquo;s own brand of furiously anti-Catholic intolerance.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBy the time of Marvell&rsquo;s death, generally attributed to a fever, on August 16, 1678, there was a reward offered by the government for the identity of the author of An Account of the Growth of Popery, though there was little doubt who the author was. Popular rumor attributed Marvell&rsquo;s death to poisoning by the Jesuits. Whatever the event, the ensuing decades would see Marvell remembered essentially as a patriot, and a great many political satires, most of which he could not have written, were attributed to him. In 1681 the folio edition of Miscellaneous Poems. By Andrew Marvell, Esq., including the lyrics that made the poet&rsquo;s 20th-century reputation, was published under mysterious circumstances. Although there is no record that Marvell ever married, the volume is prefaced by a short note by a woman claiming to be the poet&rsquo;s widow and calling herself &ldquo;Mary Marvell.&rdquo; She was in fact his housekeeper, Mary Palmer, and no one except William Empson believes that the marriage ever took place. Instead it is generally regarded as a ruse to protect Marvell&rsquo;s small estate from the depredations of his business partners&rsquo; creditors. Whatever their motivations, the editors of the Miscellaneous Poems have earned the gratitude of modern readers, and it seems fitting that a certain ambiguity should surround the posthumous publication of such ambiguous poetry.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;, Andrew Marvell  ( / \u02c8 m \u0251\u02d0r v \u0259l ,   m \u0251\u02d0r \u02c8 v \u025b l / ; 31 March 1621 \u2013 16 August 1678) was an  English   metaphysical poet , satirist and politician who sat in the  House of Commons  at various times between 1659 and 1678. During the  Commonwealth  period he was a colleague and friend of  John Milton . His poems range from the love-song \" To His Coy Mistress \", to evocations  of an aristocratic  country house  and garden in \" Upon Appleton House \" and \" The Garden \", the political address \"An  Horatian  Ode upon  Cromwell's Return from Ireland \", and the later personal and political satires \"Flecknoe\" and \"The Character of Holland\".Marvell was born in  Winestead ,  East Riding of Yorkshire  on 31 March 1621. He was the son of a  Church of England  clergyman also named Andrew Marvell (often termed Marvell Senior). [1]  The family moved to Hull when his father was appointed Lecturer at  Holy Trinity Church , and Marvell was educated at  Hull Grammar School . \nAged 13, Marvell attended  Trinity College, Cambridge  and eventually received a BA degree. [2]   A portrait of Marvell, attributed to  Godfrey Kneller , hangs in Trinity College's collection. [3]From the middle of 1642 onwards, Marvell probably travelled in continental Europe. He may well have served as a  tutor  for an aristocrat on the  Grand Tour , but the facts are not clear on this point. While England was embroiled in the  civil war , Marvell seems to have remained on the continent until 1647. During his visit to Rome in 1645, he probably met the  Villiers  brothers, Lord Francis and the  2nd   Duke of Buckingham , as well as  Richard Flecknoe . He later wrote a satirical poem about Flecknoe. [4]  His travel route is unclear, except that Milton later reported that Marvell had mastered four  languages , including  French ,  Italian  and  Spanish . [5]Marvell's first poems, which were written in  Latin  and  Greek  and published when he was still at Cambridge, lamented a visitation of the  plague  and celebrated the birth of a child to King  Charles I  and Queen  Henrietta Maria .  He belatedly became sympathetic to the successive regimes during the  Interregnum  after Charles I's execution on 30 January 1649.  His \"Horatian Ode\", a political poem dated to 1650, responds with sadness to the regicide, despite the overall praise towards  Oliver Cromwell 's return from Ireland. [6] [7] [8]Circa 1650\u201352, Marvell served as tutor to the daughter of the Lord General  Thomas Fairfax , who had recently relinquished command of the  Parliamentary army  to Cromwell. During this period, Marvell lived at  Nun Appleton Hall , near  York , where he continued to write poetry. One poem, \"Upon Appleton House, To My Lord Fairfax\", uses a description of the estate as a way of exploring Fairfax's and Marvell's own social situation in a time of war and political change. [9]  Probably the best-known poem he wrote at this time is \" To His Coy Mistress \".During the period of increasing tensions leading up to the  First Anglo-Dutch War  of 1652,  Marvell wrote the satirical \"Character of Holland\". It repeated the contemporary  stereotype  of the Dutch as \"drunken and profane\": \"This indigested vomit of the Sea,/ Fell to the Dutch by Just Propriety.\"He became a tutor to Cromwell's ward, William Dutton, in 1653, and moved to live with his pupil at   John Oxenbridge 's house in  Eton . Oxenbridge previously made two trips to  Bermuda , this most-likely inspired Marvell to write his poem  Bermudas . He also wrote several poems praising Cromwell, who was   Lord Protector  of England at that point. In 1656 Marvell and Dutton travelled to France, to visit the Protestant  Academy of Saumur . [10] [11]In 1657, Marvell joined Milton (who was now blind) in service as Latin secretary to Cromwell's  Council of State  at a salary of \u00a3200 a year. This was enough for decent financial security. Oliver Cromwell died in 1658 and was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son  Richard . In 1659 Marvell was elected  Member of Parliament  for  Kingston upon Hull  in the  Third Protectorate Parliament . [12]  He was paid a rate of 6 shillings, 8 pence per day during sittings of parliament, a financial support derived from the contributions of his constituency. [13]  He was re-elected MP for Hull in 1660 for the  Convention Parliament .The monarchy was restored in England in 1660 by returning of Charles II to his own empire. Marvell avoided punishment for his own co-operation with Cromwell and republicanism more broadly. Furthermore, he helped to convince the King not to execute John Milton for his anti-monarchical writings and revolutionary activities. [14]  The closeness of the relationship between the two former colleagues is indicated by the fact that Marvell contributed an eloquent prefatory poem, entitled \" On Mr. Milton's Paradise Lost \", to the second edition of Milton's  epic   Paradise Lost . According to a biographer: \"Skilled in the arts of self-preservation, he was not a toady.\" [15]In 1661 Marvell was re-elected MP for Hull in the  Cavalier Parliament . [12]  He eventually came to write several long and bitterly satirical verses against the corruption of the court. This work was mostly circulated in less public manuscript form, however some was anonymously published in print. The verses were too politically sensitive and too dangerous to be published under his name until well after the writer's death. Marvell took up opposition to the 'court party', and satirised them as his main target. In his longest verse of satire,  Last Instructions to a Painter , written in 1667, Marvell responded to the political corruption that had contributed to English failures during the  Second Anglo-Dutch War . The poem was only published in print after the  Revolution of 1688\u20139 . The poem instructs an imaginary painter on how to portray the state without a proper navy to defend them. The state is led by men without intelligence or courage, a corrupt and dissolute court, and dishonest officials. Of another such satire,  Samuel Pepys , himself a government official, commented in his  diary , \"Here I met with a fourth Advice to a Painter upon the coming in of the Dutch and the End of the War, that made my heart ake to read, it being too sharp and so true.\" [16]From 1659 until his death in 1678, Marvell served as London agent for the Hull Trinity House shipmasters'  guild . [ citation needed ]  He went on two missions to the continent; one to the  Dutch Republic , and the other encompassing Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. [ citation needed ]  He spent some time living in a cottage on Highgate Hill in north London.  His stay there is now recorded by a bronze plaque that bears the following inscription:Four feet below this spot is the stone step, formerly the entrance to the cottage in which lived Andrew Marvell, poet, wit, and satirist; colleague with John Milton in the foreign or Latin secretaryship during the Commonwealth; and for about twenty years M.P. for Hull. Born at Winestead, Yorkshire, 31st March, 1621, died in London, 18th August, 1678, and buried in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. This memorial is placed here by the London County Council, December, 1898. [17]A floral sundial in the nearby  Lauderdale House  bears an inscription quoting lines from his poem \"The Garden\". [18] \nAndrew Marvell died suddenly in 1678, while attending a popular meeting of his old constituents at Hull. His health had been remarkably good; and some people theorised of his poisoning by his political or clerical enemies. This is unproven. Marvell was buried in the church of  St Giles in the Fields  in central London. His monument, erected by a very grateful constituency, bears the following inscription:Near this place lyeth the body of Andrew Marvell, Esq., a man so endowed by Nature, so improved by Education, Study, and Travel, so consummated by Experience, that, joining the peculiar graces of Wit and Learning, with a singular penetration and strength of judgment; and exercising all these in the whole course of his life, with an unutterable steadiness in the ways of Virtue, he became the ornament and example of his age, beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired by all, though imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any. But a Tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is Marble necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings, nevertheless. He having served twenty years successfully in Parliament, and that with such Wisdom, Dexterity, and Courage, as becomes a true Patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, from whence he was deputed to that Assembly, lamenting in his death the public loss, have erected this Monument of their Grief and their Gratitude, 1688.Marvell also wrote anonymous prose satires: criticizing the monarchy and Roman Catholicism, defending  Puritan  dissenters, and denouncing censorship.The Rehearsal Transpros'd , an attack on  Samuel Parker , was published in two parts in 1672 and 1673.Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode , (1676) criticised  Church of England  intolerance, and was published together with a \"Short Historical Essay, concerning General Councils, Creeds, and Impositions, in matters of Religion.\"Marvell's pamphlet  An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England , published in late 1677, alleged that: \"There has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of  England  into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Popery\". [19]   John Kenyon  described it as \"one of the most influential pamphlets of the decade\" [20]  and  G. M. Trevelyan  called it: \"A fine pamphlet, which throws light on causes provocative of the formation of the  Whig party \". [21]A 1678 work published anonymously (\"by a Protestant\") in defense of  John Howe  against the attack of his fellow-dissenter, the severe Calvinist  Thomas Danson , is also probably by Marvell.  Its full title is  Remarks upon a late disingenuous discourse, writ by one T.D. under the pretence de causa Dei, and of answering Mr. John Howe's letter and postscript of God's prescience, &c., affirming, as the Protestant doctrine, that God doth by efficacious influence universally move and determine men to all their actions, even to those that are most wicked .Although Marvell became a  Parliamentarian  and was opposed to  episcopacy , he was not a  Puritan . Later in life especially, he seems to have been a conforming Anglican. [22]  Marvell positively identifies himself as \"a Protestant\" in pamphlets. [23]   He had flirted briefly with Catholicism as a youth, [24]  and was described in his thirties (on the Saumur visit) as \"a notable English Italo- Machiavellian \". [25] [26]His strong Biblical influence is clear in poems such as \" The Garden \", the \"Coronet\" and \"The Bermudas\". [27]Vincent Palmieri noted that Marvell is sometimes known as the \"British  Aristides \" for his incorruptible integrity in life and poverty at death. Many of his poems were not published until 1681, three years after his death, from a collection owned by Mary Palmer, his housekeeper. After Marvell's death she laid dubious claim to having been his wife, from the time of a secret marriage in 1667. [28]Marvell is said to have adhered to the established stylized forms of his contemporary neoclassical tradition. These include the carpe diem lyric tradition which also forms the basis of his famous lyric \"To His Coy Mistress\". He adopted familiar forms and infused them with his unique conceits, analogies, reflections and preoccupations with larger questions about life and death. [29]   T.S. Eliot  wrote of Marvell's style that \"It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace\". He also identified Marvell and the metaphysical school with the \"dissociation of sensibility\" that occurred in 17th-century English literature; Eliot described this trend as \"something which...happened to the mind of England...it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet\". [30]  Poets increasingly developed a self-conscious relationship to tradition, which took the form of a new emphasis on craftsmanship of expression and an idiosyncratic freedom in allusions to Classical and Biblical sources.\"To His Coy Mistress\", Marvell's most celebrated poem, combines an old poetic conceit (the persuasion of the speaker's lover by means of a carpe diem philosophy) with Marvell's typically vibrant imagery and easy command of rhyming couplets. Other works incorporate topical satire and religious themes.A  secondary school  in Hull, the Andrew Marvell Business and Enterprise College, is named after him. [31].",
        "response": "\r\n\n## Andrew Marvell: A Life in Poetry and Politics\n\nAndrew Marvell, born on March 31, 1621, in Winestead, England, was a poet and politician whose life and work embodied the tumultuous political and social changes of 17th-century England. Marvell's father, a clergyman, moved the family to Hull when Marvell was young, and he attended Hull Grammar School. At age 12, Marvell began his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in languages, earning his bachelor's degree in 1639. During his time at Cambridge, Marvell published his first poems, one in Latin and one in Greek, in an anthology of Cambridge poets.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1641, Marvell left Cambridge and is believed to have worked for his brother-in-law, possibly in the shipping business. During the 1640s, Marvell traveled extensively on the continent, adding Dutch, French, Spanish, and Italian to his repertoire of languages. This period of travel and exploration, which coincided with the English Civil War, had a profound impact on Marvell's worldview and would later inform his poetry and political career.\n\nIn the 1650s, Marvell worked as a tutor, first for Mary Fairfax, daughter of a retired Cromwellian general, and then for one of Oliver Cromwell's wards. It is during this time that scholars believe Marvell wrote some of his greatest lyrics, including \"To His Coy Mistress\" and \"The Garden.\" In 1657, with the help of John Milton, Marvell was appointed Milton's Latin secretary, a post he held until his election to Parliament in 1660.\n\nMarvell's political career began in 1659 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Hull, a position he held until his death in 1678. During this time, he served under Cromwell's government and later represented Hull in Parliament during the Restoration. Marvell's political stance was often ambiguous, and he was known for his satirical wit, criticizing both the court and Parliament in his writings. Many of his most famous poems, such as \"Tom May's Death,\" an attack on a Cromwellian figure, would have made him unpopular with both royalists and republicans if they had been published during his lifetime.\n\nDespite his political career, Marvell is best remembered for his poetry, which blends Cavalier grace with Metaphysical wit and complexity. His poems explore a range of themes, from love and nature to politics and religion. \"Upon Appleton House,\" a country house poem, and \"The Garden\" showcase Marvell's exquisite lyricism and subtle irony. \"An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland\" is a thought-provoking meditation on Cromwell's legacy, while \"To His Coy Mistress\" is a playful yet profound exploration of carpe diem philosophy.\n\nMarvell's later years were marked by his increasing disenchantment with the court of Charles II and his growing anti-Catholic sentiments. He wrote several political satires, including \"Clarindon's House-Warming\" and \"The Last Instructions to a Painter,\" which critiqued the king's policies and the corruption of the court. Marvell also penned prose satires, such as \"The Rehearsal Transpros'd,\" a scathing attack on Samuel Parker, an Anglican cleric who advocated for the persecution of Protestant dissenters.\n\nAndrew Marvell died suddenly on August 16, 1678, at the age of 57. His death was rumored to be caused by poisoning by Jesuits, a target of his satire. Marvell's legacy as a poet and politician endures, and he is remembered as a fierce and loyal patriot, a master of wit and satire, and one of the greatest poets of the 17th century. His work continues to fascinate scholars and readers alike, offering a unique perspective on the political and cultural transformations of his time.",

This passion followed her into adulthood, and she now lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband and their two dogs. \n\nBy day, Ann works as a technical writer, but her true passion lies in poetry. Her work has been published in a variety of literary journals and magazines, including The Missouri Review, The Adirondack Review, and The New England Review. In 2017, her first poetry collection, Mouth of Summer, was published by Kelsay Books. \n\nAnn's poetry is known for its vivid imagery and deep exploration of the natural world. She often draws on her own experiences hiking, camping, and exploring the great outdoors to craft her poems. Her work is also infused with a sense of spirituality and a search for meaning beyond the physical realm. \n\nIn \"Waves and Wet Kisses,\" Iverson uses sensory details to capture the essence of a summer day spent by the water. The poem is filled with images of light and reflection, as well as the sounds and sensations of the waves. There is a sense of peace and tranquility that comes through in her words, a feeling of being fully present in the moment. \n\nIn addition to her love of nature, Ann is also interested in the intersection of science and spirituality. Her poems often explore concepts from quantum physics, such as the idea that observation influences reality, or the many-worlds interpretation, which suggests the existence of multiple universes. She finds poetry to be a perfect medium for expressing these complex ideas in a way that is both accessible and emotionally resonant. \n\nIverson's work has been praised by critics and readers alike for its ability to capture the beauty and mystery of the natural world, as well the depth and complexity of the human spirit. Her poems have a way of staying with the reader long after the page is turned. \n\nAnn remains an active member of the literary community, participating in readings and workshops, as well as serving as a mentor to emerging poets.

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: , Anna Wickham, the pen name of Edith Alice Mary Harper, was born in 1883. Her childhood was marked by disruption and displacement, including two separate moves to Australia with her unconventional parents. She attended school in Australia and returned to England to study voice, though her marriage to Patrick Hepburn ended her career as a performer. She had four sons with Hepburn and began writing poetry in earnest during her marriage. Her first book, Songs, was published privately under the pen name John Oland around 1911. Around this time, she was committed to a mental asylum. However, the experience confirmed her devotion to poetry. Poetry collections published during her lifetime include The Contemplative Quarry (1915), The Man with a Hammer (1916), The Little Old House (1921), and Thirty-Six Poems (1926). Wickham&rsquo;s lyrical, acerbic, and frankly feminist poetry attracted the attention of Louis Untermeyer, who republished her work in the United States to enormous popularity. &nbsp; Wickham lived on the Left Bank of Paris after the death of her son in 1922. She was notorious for her ties to many of Modernism&rsquo;s leading figures, including D.H. Lawrence, David Garnett, John Gawsworth, and Natalie Clifford Barney. It is rumored she once threw Dylan Thomas out of her house during a snowstorm. Wickham and her husband separated in 1926 but reunited right before he died in 1929. During the 1930s, Wickham continued to host literary gatherings at her home in London, befriending writers such as Malcolm Lowry. She committed suicide in 1947. Incredibly prolific in her lifetime, she left behind thousands of unpublished poems., Anna Wickham  was the  pseudonym  of  Edith Alice Mary Harper  (1883 \u2013 1 May 1947), an English/Australian poet who was a pioneer of modernist poetry, and one of the most important female poets writing during the first half of the twentieth century. She was friend to other important writers of the time, such as  D. H. Lawrence ,  George Bernard Shaw ,  Katherine Mansfield  and  Dylan Thomas . Wickham lived a transnational, unconventional life, moving between Australia, England and France. She is remembered as a  modernist  figure and  feminist  writer, although one who did not command sustained critical attention in her lifetime, although her poetry did earn her a major reputation at the time of writing and had been frequently anthologised. Her literary reputation has improved since her death and she is now regarded as an important early 20th-century woman writer.She was born in  Wimbledon, London , and brought up in Australia, mostly in  Brisbane  and  Sydney . Her pen-names imply an Australian self-identification: \"Wickham\" was adopted after a Brisbane street. She had used \"John Oland\" for her first collection, which alludes to the  Jenolan Caves  in  New South Wales .Wickham returned to London in 1904, where she took singing lessons and won a drama scholarship (at the future  RADA , just founded). She pursued her singing in  Paris  in 1905 with  Jean de Reszke , the Polish tenor.In 1906 she married  Patrick Hepburn , a City of London  solicitor  with interests in  Romanesque architecture , and later  astronomy . They had four sons. They lived first in central London, then in family houses in  Hampstead :  Downshire Hill , from 1909, and then from 1919 a house on  Parliament Hill  which would be her permanent home.She became involved in the contemporary philanthropic movement concerned with maternal care, at  St Pancras Hospital .Her first collection,  Songs by John Oland , was published in 1911, and had a particular focus on the conflict between men and women, depicted in such poems as \"Song of the Low-Caste Wife\", \"Surrender\" and \"Divorce\". Other subjects included the ambition to be a writer, a post-Darwin loss of religious faith, and motherhood. Her husband was angered at her publishing a book, and subsequently also captured the interest of one of his friends in his astronomical circles. He was known to be possessive, and generally unsupportive of her singing and writing, which may have been a major factor leading to her breakdown and psychiatric hospitalisation.She was in a private psychiatric hospital in 1911 for a period of about six weeks. In her autobiographical writing she represented this occurrence as related to her husband's hostility to her writing of poetry. It followed a violent quarrel. Given the complexities of her emotional life at the time, post-natal (with two miscarriages) and in relation to parental conflicts, there would have been other factors at play, but this kind of hostility was not unusual towards pioneering women writers of the time.Shortly afterwards, she met  Harold Monro  at his  Poetry Bookshop . He encouraged her writing, and she published a second collection in 1915. This was the effective start of thirty years during which she mixed with  literati  in London (and later in Paris). She carried on a  bohemian  lifestyle, in parallel with the home life she often felt so hindered by.During  World War I  Patrick Hepburn spent time away from home, joining the  RNAS . During this time, Anna struck up a friendship with  D. H. Lawrence  and his wife Frieda. Her relations with the novelist  Eliot Bliss  are said to have been intimate. [1]Her third son Richard died of  scarlet fever  aged four. She spent a period in the early 1920s in Paris, after his death, to recuperate. There she developed a passion for  Natalie Barney . It was not returned in the same way, but they sustained a correspondence (later published as  Postcards and Poems ). She met some leading Paris figures in anglophone modernism of the time.It is believed that her marriage was in crisis during 1926, and she was separated from her husband until 1928. He died in an accident, on holiday, in 1929.During the 1930s she was well known in literary London, and wrote a great deal of poetry (much of which was later lost in war damage) and much of which remained unpublished. She did find support from the somewhat  louche   John Gawsworth , who in 1936 put out a  Richards Press  collection of her work. An extended autobiographical essay  Prelude to a Spring Clean  dates from 1935. That was the year in which she supported the just-married  Dylan Thomas  and Caitlin, and then quarrelled with them.In 1947, she committed  suicide  by hanging in her home in  Hampstead . [2].",

Born on May 31, 1819, in West Hills, New York, Whitman worked as a journalist and a teacher before finding his true calling in poetry. Known for his innovative style and bold themes, Whitman's poetry celebrates the human body, nature, and the beauty of everyday life. His most famous work, Leaves of Grass, is a collection of poems that explore these themes and challenge societal norms. Whitman's unique voice and experimental form pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in poetry at the time, and his influence can still be felt in modern poetry today. Whitman's life was filled with adventure and tragedy. He volunteered as a nurse during the American Civil War, tending to the wounded and dying soldiers. He himself almost died from a wound infection, and this experience had a profound impact on his poetry, adding a new dimension of empathy and emotional depth. After the war, Whitman struggled with poverty and ill health but continued to write and publish his poetry. He traveled widely, giving lectures and reading his work to enthusiastic audiences across America and Europe. Walt Whitman passed away on March 26, 1892, leaving behind a rich literary legacy that continues to inspire and captivate readers today."

She married Simon Bradstreet, a graduate of Cambridge University, at the age of sixteen. Two years later, Bradstreet, along with her husband and parents, immigrated to the American colonies with the Winthrop Puritan group, and the family settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts. There, Bradstreet and her husband raised eight children, and she became one of the first poets to write English verse in the American colonies. It was during this time that Bradstreet penned many of the poems that would be taken to England by her brother-in-law, purportedly without her knowledge, and published in 1650 under the title The Tenth Muse, Lately Sprung Up in America.The Tenth Muse was the only collection of Bradstreet\u2019s poetry to appear during her lifetime. In 1644, the family moved to Andover, Massachusetts, where Bradstreet lived until her death in 1672. In 1678, the first American edition of The Tenth Muse was published posthumously and expanded as Several Poems Compiled with Great Wit and Learning. Bradstreet\u2019s most highly regarded work, a sequence of religious poems titled Contemplations, was not published until the middle of the nineteenth century.Bradstreet\u2019s poetics belong to the Elizabethan literary tradition that includes Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney. She was also strongly influenced by the sixteenth-century French poet Guillaume de Salluste, seigneur du Bartas. Her early work, which is imitative and conventional in both form and content, is largely unremarkable, and her poetry was long considered primarily of historical interest. She has, however, won critical acceptance in the twentieth century for her later verse, which is less derivative and often deeply personal. In 1956, the poet John Berryman paid tribute to her in Homage to Mistress Bradstreet, a long poem that incorporates many phrases from her writings., \r\n\tAnne was born in Northampton, England in 1612 and set sail for the New World in 1630.\u00a0 Her poems were published in 1650 as The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, which is generally considered the first book of original poetry written in colonial America.\r\n\tShe was the daughter of Thomas Dudley, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1628 she married Simon Bradstreet, who later became governor of the colony. A housewife with eight children, she was also considered to be the first important poet in the American colonies. Her poems were published in 1650 as The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, which is generally considered the first book of original poetry written in colonial America. Through it she asserted the right of women to learning and expression of thought. Although some of Bradstreet's verse is conventional, much of it is direct and shows sensitivity to beauty.\r\n\t\u00a0\n\r\n\tBradstreet's most deeply felt poetry concerns the arduous life of the early settlers, and her work provides an excellent view of the difficulties she and her fellow colonists encountered. She wrote several poems in response to the early deaths of her grandchildren, and her \u201cContemplations\u201d (1678) explores her place in the natural world. Bradstreet also used her poetry to examine her religious struggles; she was unable to embrace Calvinism completely. \u201cThe Flesh and the Spirit\u201d (1678) describes the conflict she felt between living a pleasant life and living a Christian life, and \u201cMeditations Divine and Moral\u201d (written 1664; published 1867) recounts to her children her doubts about Puritanism. Although Bradstreet addressed broad and universal themes, she is remembered best for her body of evocative poems that provide intimate glimpses into the home life of inhabitants of colonial New England.\r\n\t(Bibliography taken from Encarta), Anne Bradstreet was the first woman to be recognized as an accomplished New World Poet. Her volume of poetry The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America ... received considerable favorable attention when it was first published in London in 1650. Eight years after it appeared it was listed by William London in his Catalogue of the Most Vendible Books in England, and George III is reported to have had the volume in his library. Bradstreet&#39;s work has endured, and she is still considered to be one of the most important early American poets.\r\n\r\nAlthough Anne Dudley Bradstreet did not attend school, she received an excellent education from her father, who was widely read&mdash; Cotton Mather described Thomas Dudley as a &quot;devourer of books&quot;&mdash;and from her extensive reading in the well-stocked library of the estate of the Earl of Lincoln, where she lived while her father was steward from 1619 to 1630. There the young Anne Dudley read Virgil, Plutarch, Livy, Pliny, Suetonius, Homer, Hesiod, Ovid, Seneca, and Thucydides as well as Spenser, Sidney, Milton, Raleigh, Hobbes, Joshua Sylvester&#39;s 1605 translation of Guillaume du Bartas&#39;s Divine Weeks and Workes, and the Geneva version of the Bible. In general, she benefited from the Elizabethan tradition that valued female education. In about 1628&mdash;the date is not certain&mdash;Anne Dudley married Simon Bradstreet, who assisted her father with the management of the Earl&#39;s estate in Sempringham. She remained married to him until her death on September 16, 1672. Bradstreet immigrated to the new world with her husband and parents in 1630; in 1633 the first of her children, Samuel, was born, and her seven other children were born between 1635 and 1652: Dorothy (1635), Sarah (1638), Simon (1640), Hannah (1642), Mercy (1645), Dudley (1648), and John (1652).\r\n\r\nAlthough Bradstreet was not happy to exchange the comforts of the aristocratic life of the Earl&#39;s manor house for the privations of the New England wilderness, she dutifully joined her father and husband and their families on the Puritan errand into the wilderness. After a difficult three-month crossing, their ship, the Arbella, docked at Salem, Massachusetts, on July 22, 1630. Distressed by the sickness, scarcity of food, and primitive living conditions of the New England outpost, Bradstreet admitted that her &quot;heart rose&quot; in protest against the &quot;new world and new manners.&quot; Although she ostensibly reconciled herself to the Puritan mission&mdash;she wrote that she &quot;submitted to it and joined the Church at Boston&quot;&mdash;Bradstreet remained ambivalent about the issues of salvation and redemption for most of her life.\r\n\r\nOnce in New England the passengers of the Arbella fleet were dismayed by the sickness and suffering of those colonists who had preceded them. Thomas Dudley observed in a letter to the Countess of Lincoln, who had remained in England: &quot;We found the Colony in a sad and unexpected condition, above eighty of them being dead the winter before; and many of those alive weak and sick; all the corn and bread amongst them all hardly sufficient to feed them a fortnight.&quot; In addition to fevers, malnutrition, and inadequate food supplies, the colonists also had to contend with attacks by Native Americans who originally occupied the colonized land. The Bradstreets and Dudleys shared a house in Salem for many months and lived in spartan style; Thomas Dudley complained that there was not even a table on which to eat or work. In the winter the two families were confined to the one room in which there was a fireplace. The situation was tense as well as uncomfortable, and Anne Bradstreet and her family moved several times in an effort to improve their worldly estates. From Salem they moved to Charlestown, then to Newtown (later called Cambridge), then to Ipswich, and finally to Andover in 1645.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bradstreet had eight children between the years 1633 and 1652, which meant that her domestic responsibilities were extremely demanding, she wrote poetry which expressed her commitment to the craft of writing. In addition, her work reflects the religious and emotional conflicts she experienced as a woman writer and as a Puritan. Throughout her life Bradstreet was concerned with the issues of sin and redemption, physical and emotional frailty, death and immortality. Much of her work indicates that she had a difficult time resolving the conflict she experienced between the pleasures of sensory and familial experience and the promises of heaven. As a Puritan she struggled to subdue her attachment to the world, but as a woman she sometimes felt more strongly connected to her husband, children, and community than to God.\r\n\r\nBradstreet&#39;s earliest extant poem, &quot;Upon a Fit of Sickness, Anno. 1632,&quot; written in Newtown when she was 19, outlines the traditional concerns of the Puritan&mdash;the brevity of life, the certainty of death, and the hope for salvation:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Bubble blast, how long can&#39;st last?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That always art a breaking,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sooner blown, but dead and gone,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ev&#39;n as a word that&#39;s speaking.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O whil&#39;st I live, this grace me give,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doing good may be,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then death&#39;s arrest I shall count best,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because it&#39;s thy decree.\r\n\r\nArtfully composed in a ballad meter, this poem presents a formulaic account of the transience of earthly experience which underscores the divine imperative to carry out God&#39;s will. Although this poem is an exercise in piety, it is not without ambivalence or tension between the flesh and the spirit&mdash;tensions which grow more intense as Bradstreet matures.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of her struggle between love of the world and desire for eternal life is expressed in &quot;Contemplations,&quot; a late poem which many critics consider her best:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz&#39;d\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose beams was shaded by the leavie Tree,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I look&#39;d, the more I grew amaz&#39;d\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And softly said, what glory&#39;s like to thee?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul of this world, this Universes Eye,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder, some made thee a Deity:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I not better known, (alas) the same had I\r\n\r\nAlthough this lyrical, exquisitely crafted poem concludes with Bradstreet&#39;s statement of faith in an afterlife, her faith is paradoxically achieved by immersing herself in the pleasures of earthly life. This poem and others make it clear that Bradstreet committed herself to the religious concept of salvation because she loved life on earth. Her hope for heaven was an expression of her desire to live forever rather than a wish to transcend worldly concerns. For her, heaven promised the prolongation of earthly joys, rather than a renunciation of those pleasures she enjoyed in life.\r\n\r\nBradstreet wrote many of the poems that appeared in the first edition of The Tenth Muse ... during the years 1635 to 1645 while she lived in the frontier town of Ipswich, approximately thirty miles from Boston. In her dedication to the volume written in 1642 to her father, Thomas Dudley, who educated her, encouraged her to read, and evidently appreciated his daughter&#39;s intelligence, Bradstreet pays &quot;homage&quot; to him. Many of the poems in this volume tend to be dutiful exercises intended to prove her artistic worth to him. However, much of her work, especially her later poems, demonstrates impressive intelligence and mastery of poetic form.\r\n\r\nThe first section of The Tenth Muse ... includes four long poems, known as the quaternions, or &quot;The Four Elements,&quot; &quot;The Four Humors of Man,&quot; &quot;The Four Ages of Man,&quot; and &quot;The Four Seasons.&quot; Each poem consists of a series of orations; the first by earth, air, fire, and water; the second by choler, blood, melancholy, and flegme; the third by childhood, youth, middle age, and old age; the fourth by spring, summer, fall, and winter. In these quaternions Bradstreet demonstrates a mastery of physiology, anatomy, astronomy, Greek metaphysics, and the concepts of medieval and Renaissance cosmology. Although she draws heavily on Sylvester&#39;s translation of du Bartas and Helkiah Crooke&#39;s anatomical treatise Microcosmographia (1615), Bradstreet&#39;s interpretation of their images is often strikingly dramatic. Sometimes she uses material from her own life in these historical and philosophical discourses. For example, in her description of the earliest age of man, infancy, she forcefully describes the illnesses that assailed her and her children:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What gripes of wind my infancy did pain,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What tortures I in breeding teeth sustain?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What crudityes my stomach cold has bred,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence vomits, flux, and worms have issued?\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the quaternions, the poems in the next section of The Tenth Muse&mdash;&quot;The Four Monarchies&quot; (Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman)&mdash;are poems of commanding historical breadth. Bradstreet&#39;s poetic version of the rise and fall of these great empires draws largely from Sir Walter Raleigh&#39;s History of the World (1614). The dissolution of these civilizations is presented as evidence of God&#39;s divine plan for the world. Although Bradstreet demonstrates considerable erudition in both the quaternions and monarchies, the rhymed couplets of the poems tend to be plodding and dull; she even calls them &quot;lanke&quot; and &quot;weary&quot; herself. Perhaps she grew tired of the task she set for herself because she did not attempt to complete the fourth section on the &quot;Roman Monarchy&quot; after the incomplete portion was lost in a fire that destroyed the Bradstreet home in 1666.\r\n\r\n&quot;Dialogue between Old England and New,&quot; also in the 1650 edition of The Tenth Muse ... expresses Bradstreet&#39;s concerns with the social and religious turmoil in England that impelled the Puritans to leave their country. The poem is a conversation between mother England and her daughter, New England. The sympathetic tone reveals how deeply attached Bradstreet was to her native land and how disturbed she was by the waste and loss of life caused by the political upheaval. As Old England&#39;s lament indicates, the destructive impact of the civil strife on human life was more disturbing to Bradstreet than the substance of the conflict:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O pity me in this sad perturbation,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My plundered Towers, my houses devastation,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My weeping Virgins and my young men slain;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wealthy trading fall&#39;n, my dearth of grain\r\n\r\nIn this poem, Bradstreet&#39;s voices her own values. There is less imitation of traditional male models and more direct statement of the poet&#39;s feelings. As Bradstreet gained experience, she depended less on poetic mentors and relied more on her own perceptions.\r\n\r\nAnother poem in the first edition of The Tenth Muse ... that reveals Bradstreet&#39;s personal feelings is &quot;In Honor of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,&quot; written in 1643, in which she praises the Queen as a paragon of female prowess. Chiding her male readers for trivializing women, Bradstreet refers to the Queen&#39;s outstanding leadership and historical prominence. In a personal caveat underscoring her own dislike of patriarchal arrogance, Bradstreet points out that women were not always devalued:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let such as say our Sex is void of Reason,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.\r\n\r\nThese assertive lines mark a dramatic shift from the self-effacing stanzas of &quot;The Prologue&quot; to the volume in which Bradstreet attempted to diminish her stature to prevent her writing from being attacked as an indecorous female activity. In an ironic and often-quoted passage of &quot;The Prologue,&quot; she asks for the domestic herbs &quot;Thyme or Parsley wreath,&quot; instead of the traditional laurel, thereby appearing to subordinate herself to male writers and critics:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men have precedency and still excell,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is but vain unjustly to wage warre;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men can do best, and women know it well\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preheminence in all and each is yours;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, her portrait of Elizabeth does not attempt to conceal her confidence in the abilities of women:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was so good, so just, so learned so wise,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From all the Kings on earth she won the prize.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor say I more then duly is her due,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions will testifie that this is true.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has wip&#39;d off th&#39; aspersion of her Sex,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That women wisdome lack to play the Rex\r\n\r\nThis praise for Queen Elizabeth expresses Bradstreet&#39;s conviction that women should not be subordinated to men&mdash;certainly it was less stressful to make this statement in a historic context than it would have been to confidently proclaim the worth of her own work.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of The Tenth Muse ... also contains an elegy to Sir Philip Sidney and a poem honoring du Bartas. Acknowledging her debt to these poetic mentors, she depicts herself as insignificant in contrast to their greatness. They live on the peak of Parnassus while she grovels at the bottom of the mountain. Again, her modest pose represents an effort to ward off potential attackers, but its ironic undercurrents indicate that Bradstreet was angered by the cultural bias against women writers:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fain would I shew how he same paths did tread,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now into such Lab&#39;rinths I am lead,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With endless turnes, the way I find not out,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to persist my Muse is more in doubt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which makes me now with Silvester confess,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sidney&#39;s Muse can sing his worthiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ostensible meaning of this passage is that Sidney&#39;s work is too complex and intricate for her to follow, it also indicates that Bradstreet felt his labyrinthine lines to represent excessive artifice and lack of connection to life.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of The Tenth Muse ..., published in Boston in 1678 as Several Poems ..., contains the author&#39;s corrections as well as previously unpublished poems: epitaphs to her father and mother, &quot;Contemplations,&quot; &quot;The Flesh and the Spirit,&quot; the address by &quot;The Author to her Book,&quot; several poems about her various illnesses, love poems to her husband, and elegies of her deceased grandchildren and daughter-in-law. These poems added to the second edition were probably written after the move to Andover, where Anne Bradstreet lived with her family in a spacious three-story house until her death in 1672. Far superior to her early work, the poems in the 1678 edition demonstrate a command over subject matter and a mastery of poetic craft. These later poems are considerably more candid about her spiritual crises and her strong attachment to her family than her earlier work. For example, in a poem to her husband, &quot;Before the Birth of one of her Children,&quot; Bradstreet confesses that she is afraid of dying in childbirth&mdash;a realistic fear in the 17th century&mdash;and begs him to continue to love her after her death. She also implores him to take good care of their children and to protect them from a potential stepmother&#39;s cruelty:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when thou feel&#39;st no grief, as I no harms,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look to my little babes my dear remains.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if thou love thy self, or love&#39;st me\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These O protect from step Dames injury.\r\n\r\nNot only is this candid domestic portrait artistically superior to of &quot;The Four Monarchies,&quot; it gives a more accurate sense of Bradstreet&#39;s true concerns.\r\n\r\nIn her address to her book, Bradstreet repeats her apology for the defects of her poems, likening them to children dressed in &quot;home-spun.&quot; But what she identifies as weakness is actually their strength. Because they are centered in the poet&#39;s actual experience as a Puritan and as a woman, the poems are less figurative and contain fewer analogies to well-known male poets than her earlier work. In place of self-conscious imagery is extraordinarily evocative and lyrical language. In some of these poems Bradstreet openly grieves over the loss of her loved ones&mdash;her parents, her grandchildren, her sister-in-law&mdash;and she barely conceals resentment that God has taken their innocent lives. Although she ultimately capitulates to a supreme being&mdash;He knows it is the best for thee and me&quot;&mdash;it is the tension between her desire for earthly happiness and her effort to accept God&#39;s will that makes these poems especially powerful.\r\n\r\nBradstreet&#39;s poems to her husband are often singled out for praise by critics. Simon Bradstreet&#39;s responsibilities as a magistrate of the colony frequently took him away from home, and he was very much missed by his wife. Modeled on Elizabethan sonnets, Bradstreet&#39;s love poems make it clear that she was deeply attached to her husband:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever two were one, then surely we\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever man were lov&#39;d by wife, then thee;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever wife was happy in a man\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare with me ye women if you can\r\n\r\nMarriage was important to the Puritans, who felt that the procreation and proper training of children were necessary for building God&#39;s commonwealth. However, the love between wife and husband was not supposed to distract from devotion to God. In Bradstreet&#39;s sonnets, her erotic attraction to her husband is central, and these poems are more secular than religious:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return, return sweet Sol from Capricorn;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this dead time, alas, what can I more\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than view those fruits which through thy heat I bore?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Bradstreet&#39;s brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, was responsible for the publication of the first edition of The Tenth Muse.... The title page reads &quot;By a Gentlewoman in those parts&quot;&mdash;and Woodbridge assures readers that the volume &quot;is the work of a Woman, honored and esteemed where she lives.&quot; After praising the author&#39;s piety, courtesy, and diligence, he explains that she did not shirk her domestic responsibilities in order to write poetry: &quot;these poems are the fruit but of some few hours, curtailed from sleep and other refreshments.&quot; Also prefacing the volume are statements of praise for Bradstreet by Nathaniel Ward, the author of The Simple Cobler of Aggawam (1647), and Reverend Benjamin Woodbridge, brother of John Woodbridge. In order to defend her from attacks from reviewers at home and abroad who might be shocked by the impropriety of a female author, these encomiums of the poet stress that she is a virtuous woman.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, John Harvard Ellis published Bradstreet&#39;s complete works, including materials from both editions of The Tenth Muse ... as well as &quot;Religious Experiences and Occasional Pieces&quot; and &quot;Meditations Divine and Morall&quot; that had been in the possession of her son Simon Bradstreet, to whom the meditations had been dedicated on &nbsp;March 20, 1664. Bradstreet&#39;s accounts of her religious experience provide insight into the Puritan views of salvation and redemption. Bradstreet describes herself as having been frequently chastened by God through her illnesses and her domestic travails: &quot;Among all my experiences of God&#39;s gractious Dealings with me I have constantly observed this, that he has never suffered me long to sit loose from him, but by one affliction or other hath made me look home, and search what was amiss.&quot; Puritans perceived suffering as a means of preparing the heart to receive God&#39;s grace. Bradstreet writes that she made every effort to submit willingly to God&#39;s afflictions which were necessary to her &quot;straying soul which in prosperity is too much in love with the world.&quot; These occasional pieces in the Ellis edition also include poems of gratitude to God for protecting her loved ones from illness (&quot;Upon my Daughter Hannah Wiggin her recovering from a dangerous fever&quot;) and for her husband&#39;s safe return from England. However, these poems do not have the force or power of those published in the second edition of The Tenth Muse ... and seem to be exercises in piety and submission rather than a complex rendering of her experience.\r\n\r\nThe aphoristic prose paragraphs of &quot;Meditations Divine and Morall&quot; have remarkable vitality, primarily because they are based on her own observations and experiences. While the Bible and the Bay Psalm Book are the source of many of Bradstreet&#39;s metaphors, they are reworked to confirm her perceptions: &quot;The spring is a lively emblem of the resurrection, after a long winter we see the leaveless trees and dry stocks (at the approach of the sun) to resume their former vigor and beauty in a more ample manner than when they lost in the Autumn; so shall it be at that great day after a long vacation, when the Sun of righteousness shall appear, those dry bones shall arise in far more glory then that which they lost at their creation, and in this transcends the spring, that their lease shall never fail, nor their sap decline&quot; (40)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important aspect of Anne Bradstreet&#39;s poetic evolution is her increasing confidence in the validity of her personal experience as a source and subject of poetry. Much of the work in the 1650 edition of The Tenth Muse ... suffers from being imitative and strained. The forced rhymes reveal Bradstreet&#39;s grim determination to prove that she could write in the lofty style of the established male poets. But her deeper emotions were obviously not engaged in the project. The publication of her first volume of poetry seems to have given her confidence and enabled her to express herself more freely. As she began to write of her ambivalence about the religious issues of faith, grace, and salvation, her poetry became more accomplished.\r\n\r\nBradstreet&#39;s recent biographers, Elizabeth Wade White and Ann Stanford, have both observed that Bradstreet was sometimes distressed by the conflicting demands of piety and poetry and was as daring as she could be and still retain respectability in a society that exiled Anne Hutchinson. Bradstreet&#39;s poetry reflects the tensions of a woman who wished to express her individuality in a culture that was hostile to personal autonomy and valued poetry only if it praised God. Although Bradstreet never renounced her religious belief, her poetry makes it clear that if it were not for the fact of dissolution and decay, she would not seek eternal life: &quot;for were earthly comforts permanent, who would look for heavenly?&quot;\r\n\r\nIn a statement of extravagant praise Cotton Mather compared Anne Bradstreet to such famous women as Hippatia, Sarocchia, the three Corinnes, and Empress Eudocia and concluded that her poems have &quot;afforded a grateful Entertainment unto the Ingenious, and a Monument for her Memory beyond the stateliest Marbles.&quot; Certainly, Anne Bradstreet&#39;s poetry has continued to receive a positive response for more than three centuries, and she has earned her place as one of the most important American women poets., Anne Bradstreet  ( n\u00e9e   Dudley ; March 8, 1612 \u2013 September 16, 1672) was the most prominent of early  English  poets of  North America  and first writer in England's North American colonies to be published. She is the first  Puritan  figure in  American Literature  and notable for her large corpus of poetry, as well as personal writings published posthumously.Born to a wealthy Puritan family in  Northampton , England, Bradstreet was a well-read scholar especially affected by the works of  Du Bartas . She was married at sixteen, and her parents and young family migrated at the time of the founding of  Massachusetts Bay Colony  in 1630.  A mother of eight children and the wife and daughter of public officials in New England, Bradstreet wrote poetry in addition to her other duties. Her early works read in the style of Du Bartas, but her later writings develop into her unique style of poetry which centers on her role as a mother, her struggles with the sufferings of life, and her Puritan faith.  Her first collection,  The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America , was widely read in America and England.In a portrait that was painted by her later poems, Bradstreet is described as \"an educated English woman, a kind, loving wife, devoted mother, Empress Consort of Massachusetts, a questing Puritan and a sensitive poet.\" [2]Bradstreet's first volume of poetry was  The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America , published in 1650. It was met with a positive reception in both the  Old World  and the  New World . [3] [4]Anne was born in  Northampton , England in 1612, the daughter of  Thomas Dudley , a steward of the  Earl of Lincoln , and Dorothy Yorke. [5]Due to her family's position, she grew up in cultured circumstances and was a well-educated woman for her time, being tutored in history, several languages, and literature. At the age of sixteen she married  Simon Bradstreet . Both Anne's father and husband were later to serve as governors of the  Massachusetts Bay Colony . Anne and Simon, along with Anne's parents, emigrated to America aboard the  Arbella  as part of the  Winthrop Fleet  of Puritan emigrants in 1630. [6]She first stood on American soil on June 14, 1630, at what is now  Pioneer Village (Salem, Massachusetts)  with Simon, her parents, and other voyagers as part of the  Puritan migration to New England (1620\u20131640) . Due to the illness and starvation of Gov.  John Endecott  and other residents of the village, their stay was very brief. Most moved immediately south along the coast to  Charlestown, Massachusetts , for another short stay before moving south along the  Charles River  to found \"the City on the Hill,\"  Boston, Massachusetts . [ citation needed ]The Bradstreet family soon moved again, this time to what is now  Cambridge, Massachusetts . In 1632, Anne had her first child, Samuel, in \"Newe Towne,\" as it was then called. Despite poor health, she had eight children and achieved a comfortable social standing. Having previously been afflicted with  smallpox  as a teenager in England, Anne would once again fall prey to illness as paralysis overtook her joints in later years. In the early 1640s, Simon once again pressed his wife, pregnant with her sixth child, to move for the sixth time, from  Ipswich, Massachusetts , to Andover Parish. North Andover is that original town founded in 1646 by the Stevens, Osgood, Johnson, Farnum, Barker, and Bradstreet families, among others. Anne and her family resided in the Old Center of what is now  North Andover, Massachusetts . [ citation needed ]Both Anne's father and her husband were instrumental in the founding of  Harvard University  in 1636. Two of her sons were graduates, Samuel (Class of 1653) and Simon (Class of 1660). In October 1997, the Harvard community dedicated a gate in memory of her as America's first published poet (see last paragraph below). The Bradstreet Gate is located next to Canaday Hall, the newest dormitory in  Harvard Yard . [ citation needed ]In 1650, Rev. John Woodbridge had  The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America  composed by \"A Gentlewoman from Those Parts\" published in  London , making Anne the first female poet ever published in both  England  and the  New World . On July 10, 1666, their  North Andover  family home burned (see \"Works\" below) in a fire that left the Bradstreets homeless and with few personal belongings. Recent archaeological excavation may have located the site of this homestead, which had been the subject of uncertainty over the centuries. [7]  By then, Anne's health was slowly failing. She suffered from  tuberculosis  and had to deal with the loss of cherished relatives. But her will remained strong and as a reflection of her religious devotion and knowledge of the Bible, she found peace in the firm belief that her daughter-in-law Mercy and her grandchildren were in heaven. [ citation needed ]Anne Bradstreet died on September 16, 1672, in  North Andover, Massachusetts , at the age of 60. The precise location of her grave is uncertain but many historians believe her body is in the Old Burying Ground at Academy Road and Osgood Street in North Andover. In 1676, four years after the death of Anne, Simon Bradstreet married for a second time to a lady also named Anne (Gardiner). In 1697, Simon died and was buried in Salem. This area of the  Merrimack Valley  is today described as \"The Valley of the Poets.\" [ citation needed ]A marker in the North Andover cemetery commemorates the 350th anniversary (2000) of the publishing of  The Tenth Muse  in  London  in 1650. That site and the Bradstreet Gate at Harvard, the memorial and pamphlets inside the Ipswich Public Library in Ipswich, MA, as well as the Bradstreet Kindergarten in North Andover may be the only places in America honoring her memory. [ citation needed ]As of 2015, the Bradstreet Kindergarten was torn down in North Andover. In the fall of 2018, The Anne Bradstreet Early Childhood Center was opened near Massachusetts Avenue in North Andover. Housing both preschool and kindergarten, the Anne Bradstreet ECC replaced the aged building named for her that had been on Main Street. [ citation needed ]Anne Bradstreet's education gave her advantages that allowed her to write with authority about politics, history, medicine, and theology. Her personal library of books was said to have numbered over 800, although many were destroyed when her home burned down. This event itself inspired a poem titled \" Upon the Burning of Our House July 10th, 1666 \". At first, she rejects the anger and grief that this worldly tragedy has caused her; she looks toward God and the assurance of heaven as consolation, saying: [ citation needed ]And when I could no longer look, \nI blest His grace that gave and took, \nThat laid my goods now in the dust. \nYea, so it was, and so 'twas just. \nIt was his own; it was not mine. \nFar be it that I should repine.However, in opposition to her Puritan ways, she also shows her human side, expressing the pain this event had caused her, that is, until the poem comes to its end:Farewell my pelf; farewell my store.  \nThe world no longer let me love \nMy hope, and treasure lies above.As a younger poet, Bradstreet wrote five quaternions, epic poems of four parts each (see works below) that explore the diverse yet complementary natures of their subject. [8]  Much of Bradstreet's poetry is based on observation of the world around her, focusing heavily on domestic and religious themes, and was considered by  Cotton Mather  \"a monument to her memory beyond the stateliest marble\". [9]  Long considered primarily of historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems \"Contemplations\", which was written for her family and not published until the mid-19th century. [10]Nearly a century later,  Martha Wadsworth Brewster , a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, in her principal work,  Poems on Diverse Subjects , was influenced and pays homage to Bradstreet's verse. [ citation needed ]Despite the traditional attitude toward women of the time, she clearly valued knowledge and intellect; she was a  free thinker  and some consider her an early  feminist ; unlike the more radical  Anne Hutchinson , however, Bradstreet's feminism does not reflect heterodox,  antinomian  views. [11]Her Victories in foreign Coasts resound? \nShips more invincible than Spain's, her foe \nShe rack't, she sack'd, she sunk his Armadoe. \nHer stately Troops advanc'd to Lisbon's wall, \nDon Anthony in's right for to install. \nShe frankly help'd Franks' (brave) distressed King, \nThe States united now her fame do sing.In 1647, Bradstreet's brother-in-law, Rev.  John Woodbridge , sailed to England, carrying her manuscript of poetry. Although Anne later said that she did not know Woodbridge was going to publish her manuscript, in her self-deprecatory poem, \"\"The Author to Her Book\"\", she wrote Woodbridge a letter while he was in London, indicating her knowledge of the publication plan. Anne had little choice, however\u2014 as a woman poet, it was important for her to downplay her ambitions as an author. Otherwise, she would have faced criticism for being \"unwomanly.\" [12]  Anne's first work was published in London as  The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America  \"by a Gentlewoman of those Parts\".The purpose of the publication appears to have been an attempt by devout Puritan men ( i.e.  Thomas Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, John Woodbridge) to show that a godly and educated woman could elevate her position as a wife and mother, without necessarily placing her in competition with men. In 1678, her self-revised  Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning  was posthumously published in America, and included one of her most famous poems, \" To My Dear and Loving Husband \". [13]  This volume is owned by the Stevens Memorial Library of North Andover and resides in the  Houghton Library  vault at Harvard.A quotation from Bradstreet can be found on a plaque at the Bradstreet Gate in  Harvard Yard : \"I came into this Country, where I found a new World and new manners at which my heart rose.\" [14]  Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is \"But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston.\" This suggests her heart rose up in protest [15]  rather than in joy.Marriage played a large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, \"To My Dear And Loving Husband,\" [16]  she reveals that she is one with her husband. \"If ever two were one, then surely we.\" [16]  The Puritans believed marriage to be a gift from God. In another of Bradstreet's works, \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\", [17]  Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage in the lines, \"And if I see not half my days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you\". [17]  Bradstreet could be referring to her husband remarrying after she dies. Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, \"These O protect from stepdame's injury\", [17]  Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future stepmother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage. [ citation needed ]Throughout \"Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment,\" Bradstreet states how she feels lost when her husband is not around and that life is always better when he is around. In Bradstreet's poems, it can be assumed she truly loved her husband and missed him when he was away from her and the family. Bradstreet does not resent her husband for leaving her with the family and with all of the household needs; she just misses him and wants him back with her. [18] [19] [20]Various works of Bradstreet are dedicated to her children. In works such as \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\" [17]  and \"In Reference to Her Children\", [21]  Bradstreet articulated the love that she has for her children, both unborn and born. In Puritan society, children were also gifts from God, and she loved and cared for all of her children just as she loved and cared for her husband. She always believes they too are bound with her to make \"one.\" [ citation needed ]As writing was not considered to be an acceptable role for women at the time, Bradstreet was met with criticism. One of the most prominent figures of her time,  John Winthrop , criticized Ann Hopkins, wife of prominent Connecticut colony governor Edward Hopkins. He mentioned in his journal that Hopkins should have kept to being a housewife and left writing and reading for men, \"whose minds are stronger.\" Despite heavy criticism of women during her time, Bradstreet continued to write, which led to the belief [ by whom? ]  that she was interested in rebelling against societal norms of the time. A prominent minister of the time,  Thomas Parker , was also against the idea of women writing and sent a letter to his own sister saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were supposed to do. No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men. [22]Bradstreet let her homesick imagination marshall her store of learning, for the glory of God and for the expression of an inquiring mind and sensitive, philosophical spirit. [23]We see examples of this homesick imagination in her poem \"Dialogue Between Old England and New\" which emphasizes the relationship between the motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue. It also implies that whatever happens to England will also affect America. The poem often refers to England as \"mother\" and America as \"Daughter\", which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country. [ citation needed ]Alas, dear Mother, fairest Queen and best, \nWith honour, wealth, and peace happy and blest, \nWhat ails thee hang thy head, and cross thine arms, \nAnd sit i' the dust to sigh these sad alarms? \nWhat deluge of new woes thus over-whelm \nThe glories of thy ever famous Realm? \nWhat means this wailing tone, this mournful guise? \nAh, tell thy Daughter; she may sympathize.Anne Bradstreet's works tend to be directed to members of her family and are generally intimate. For instance, in Bradstreet's \" To My Dear and Loving Husband \", the poem's intended audience is her husband, Simon Bradstreet. In \"A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment\" [24]  Bradstreet writes a letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to describe her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer can be seen as a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. \"Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn.\" [24]  She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. \"Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence.\" [24]Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. [25]Bradstreet was not responsible for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet's brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her work off to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry was not meant to bring attention to herself. [26]The role of women is a common subject found in Bradstreet's poems. Living in a  Puritan  society, Bradstreet did not approve of the\nstereotypical idea that women were inferior to men during the 1600s. Women were expected to spend all their time cooking, cleaning, taking care of their children, and attending to their husband's every need. In her poem \"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,\" Bradstreet questions this belief. [27]\"Now say, have women worth? or have they none?\nOr had they some, but with our queen is't gone?\nNay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long,\nBut she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong,\nLet such as say our Sex is void of Reason,\nKnow tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.\" [ citation needed ]Another recurring subject in Bradstreet's work is mortality. In many of her works, she writes about her death and how it will affect her children and others in her life. The recurrence of this mortality theme can be viewed as autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, she was referring to her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings. She hoped her children would think of her fondly and honor her memory in her poem, \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children.\"\n\t\"If any worth or virtue were in me,\n\tLet that live freshly in thy memory.\" [ citation needed ]Bradstreet is also known for using her poetry as a means to question her own Puritan beliefs; her doubt concerning God's mercy and her struggles to continue to place her faith in him are exemplified in such poems as \"Verses upon the Burning of our House\" and  \"In Memory of My Dear Grandchild\". Her works demonstrate a conflict that many Puritans would not have felt comfortable discussing, let alone writing. [ citation needed ]In \"The Prologue,\" Bradstreet demonstrates how society trivialized the accomplishments of women. The popular belief that women should be doing other things like sewing, rather than writing poetry. [ citation needed ]\"I am obnoxious to each carping tongue\nWho says my hand a needle better fits,\nA poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong.\nFor such despite they cast on female wits:\nIf what I do prove well, it won't advance,\nThey'll say it's stol'n, or else it was by chance.\" [28]In \"To My Dear and Loving Husband,\" Bradstreet confesses her undying love for Simon saying \"Thy love is such I can no way repay, The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.\" Her deep passions can be found again in \"A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment.\" Her overt affections for her husband help readers to understand Bradstreet's temerity. [29]Anne Bradstreet wrote in a different format than other writers of her time. This mainly is due to the fact that she wrote her feelings in a book not knowing someone would read them. In her poem \"A letter to my Husband\" she speaks about the loss of her husband when he is gone.\"I like the earth this season morn in black, my sun is gone.\" Here Anne is expressing her feelings of missing her husband when he is away. [ citation needed ]\"To my faults that well you know I have let be interred in my oblivious grave; if any worth of virtue were in me, let that live freshly in they memory\". Anne expresses the feeling she has of wanting her children to remember her in a good light not in a bad light. [ citation needed ]Bradstreet often used a sarcastic tone in her poetry. In the first\nstanza of \"The Prologue\" she claims \"for my mean pen are too\nsuperior things\" referring to society's belief that she is unfit to\nwrite about wars and the founding of cities because she is a woman. In\nstanza five Bradstreet continues to display irony by stating \"who says\nmy hand a needle better fits\". This is another example of her\nsarcastic voice because society during this time expected women to\nperform household chores rather than write poetry. [30]Although Anne Bradstreet endured many hardships in her life, her poems\nare usually written in a hopeful and positive tone. Throughout her\npoem In \"Memory of My Dear Grandchild Simon Bradstreet,\" she mentions\nthat even though she has lost her grandson in this world, she\nwill one day be reunited with him in Heaven. [31]  In \"Upon the\nBurning of Our House,\" Bradstreet describes her house in flames but\nselflessly declares \"there's wealth enough, I need no more.\" Although\nBradstreet lost many of her material items she kept a positive\nattitude and found strength through her belief in God. [32]Bradstreet wrote four  quaternions , \"Seasons,\" \"Elements,\" \"Humours,\" and \"Ages,\" which made possible her \"development as a poet in terms of technical craftsmanship as she learned to fashion the form artistically.\" [ citation needed ]Bradstreet's first two quaternions were her most successful. [33]  The central tension in her work is that between delight in the world and belief of its vanity. [ citation needed ]Homage to Mistress Bradstreet , John Berryman, Faber and Faber, 1959.",
        "response": "<|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Certainly, Anne Bradstreet's poetry has endured for centuries, and she is widely regarded as one of the most significant early American poets. Born Anne Dudley in 1612 in Northamptonshire, England, she received an excellent education from her father and through her own extensive reading. At 16, she married Simon Bradstreet, a Cambridge University graduate. Two years later, the couple, along with Anne's parents, immigrated to the American colonies with the Winthrop Puritan group, settling in Ipswich, Massachusetts.\n\nAnne and Simon Bradstreet would go on to have eight children and lead a life marked by both comfort and hardship. Anne's father and husband both served as governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the family enjoyed a relatively privileged existence. However, Anne's life was also marked by illness, the loss of loved ones, and the challenges of colonial life. She contracted smallpox as a teenager and later suffered from partial paralysis. In 1666, their family home in North Andover burned down, destroying many of her personal belongings and writings.\n\nDespite these difficulties, Anne Bradstreet found solace and expression in poetry. She is considered one of the first poets to write English verse in the American colonies, and her work offers a unique perspective on the early colonial experience. Her early poems were influenced by the French poet Guillaume de Salluste and follow the Elizabethan literary tradition, including poets like Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney. These early works are often seen as imitative and conventional.\n\nIt was her later verse, however, that established her critical acclaim. Bradstreet's poetry became less derivative and more personal, exploring her religious struggles, her role as a mother, and the hardships of colonial life. Her most highly regarded work, \"Contemplations,\" is a sequence of religious poems that grapple with her faith and the Puritan doctrine of the time. In poems like \"Upon a Fit of Sickness, Anno. 1632,\" written when she was just 19, we see the traditional Puritan concerns of mortality and salvation.\n\nBut as Bradstreet matured, her poetry became more complex and nuanced. In \"Contemplations,\" she expresses her struggle between her love for the world and her desire for eternal life. Bradstreet's faith is paradoxically tied to her immersion in earthly pleasures, and her hope for heaven is an extension of her desire to prolong these joys. This tension between the earthly and the divine is a recurring theme in her work.\n\nAnne Bradstreet's first volume of poetry, \"The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America,\" was published in 1650 and received positive reception in both the Old World and the New. This made her the first female poet to be published in both England and the American colonies. The publication was facilitated by her brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, who took her manuscript to England without her knowledge. Bradstreet's second volume, \"Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning,\" was published posthumously in 1678 and included some of her most famous poems, like \"To My Dear and Loving Husband.\"\n\nBradstreet's poetry is intimate and often directed at members of her family. In \"To My Dear and Loving Husband,\" she expresses her deep love and devotion, while in \"Before the Birth of One of Her Children,\" she articulates her fears of dying in childbirth and her hopes for her children's future. Bradstreet's work also reflects on her role as a woman in a patriarchal society. In \"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,\" she challenges the notion that women are inferior to men and celebrates the accomplishments of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAnne Bradstreet's poetry is a testament to her resilience, faith, and talent. Through her words, we gain insight into the life and struggles of a Puritan woman in colonial America. Her work continues to inspire and influence readers today, solidifying her place as a pioneering and enduring poet in American literature.",

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Anne Bront\u00eb was born on January 17, 1820, in Thornton, England. The youngest of six children, she grew up in nearby Haworth, where her father, Patrick Bront\u00eb, was the curate of the local church. Anne\u2019s mother passed away in 1821, and her two oldest sisters died of tuberculosis in 1824.Anne was educated at Haworth with her brother Branwell and her sisters Charlotte and Emily. There, she wrote poetry and prose set in the imaginary kingdom of Gondal. She pursued more formal studies at Roe Head School for two years, and she served as a governess for two families between 1839 and 1845.In 1846, Charlotte arranged for the publication of the three sisters\u2019 poems under the title The Poems of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell (Aylott and Jones, 1846).\u00a0 Anne went on to publish two novels under the pseudonym Acton Bell: Agnes Grey (Thomas Cautley Newby, 1847) and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Thomas Cautley Newby, 1848).Anne died of tuberculosis on May 28, 1849, shortly after the deaths of both Branwell and Emily Bront\u00eb., Anne was born 17 January 1820, youngest child of Patrick Bront\u00eb and Maria Branwell Bront\u00eb. Her mother died when she was only a year old, and when the two oldest siblings died of consumption in 1825, Anne was really too young to remember. She and Emily were especially close, writing together on their imaginary world of Gondal, a kingdom mostly separate from Angria, which Charlotte and brother Branwell wrote about. Like all the Bront\u00eb sisters, Anne was rather too dependent on these imaginary writings, but she had a strong sense of family duty. So she went away to school, where there was no time for such flights of fancy, and trained as a governess.\n\nHer health was not terribly good, but she perservered. In May of 1840, she went as governess to the home of the Reverend Edmund Robinson, where she would work for some years. \n\n\n\nIn 1843, Branwell went with Anne to the Robinsons' to act as tutor to the older boys of the family. When Branwell was dismissed in disgrace about two years later, Anne resigned her post, feeling that was the only proper thing to do. Though she was apparently glad to leave the post, she was depressed over the uncertainty of her future. \n\n\n\nThe publication of the sisters' Poems in May 1846 was quite a bright spot for her, even though they didn't sell very well. Still, this publication encouraged all of them to write novels for publication, Anne's contribution being Agnes Grey. This novel, like Emily's Wuthering Heights, was published right after Jane Eyre in hopes of cashing in on that novel's success. Anne was at least optimistic enough to write a second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. \n\n\n\nWhen Branwell died in September of 1848, it was Anne who took over many of the necessary arrangements, as Charlotte had taken ill. When Emily died of consumption three months later, Charlotte was the pillar of strength, as Anne herself was beginning to feel the first symptoms of her own fatal illness. The only thing that cheered her was the quiet but noticeable success of her poems in various literary magazines. \n\nWhen she was told that she, too, had consumption, in January of 1849, she nearly broke down completely under the weight of illness and her own religious doubts, but hid her panic from her family, still reeling from the two previous losses. Using a legacy from Anne's recently-desceased godmother, Charlotte took her to the seaside (which she loved) in hopes of a cure. She died at Scarborough on 28 May 1849; her last words being, \"Take courage, Charlotte, take courage.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bibliography taken from incompetec.com)\n, In Conversations in Ebury Street  (1924), George Moore declared that &quot;if Anne Bront&euml; had lived ten years longer, she would have taken a place beside Jane Austen, perhaps even a higher place&quot;; in addition, he described her first novel, Agnes Grey (1847), as &quot;the most perfect prose narrative in English literature.&quot;\r\n\r\nIf Moore&#39;s estimation of Bront&euml;&#39;s work and potential was somewhat inflated, his claims for her served as an overdue and refreshing corrective to the trend&mdash;long established by biographers and critics&mdash;of either damning her with faint praise or making her the subject of frankly disparaging remarks. Typical of the latter were May Sinclair&#39;s dismissal of her as &quot;the weak and ineffectual Anne&quot; and George Saintsbury&#39;s pronouncement that &quot;the third sister Anne is but a pale reflection of her elders.&quot; The cumulative effect made Bront&euml; appear a nebulous figure in the history of English letters; and led to the widely accepted concept of her as an artist and a woman of no importance.\r\n\r\nThe source of this misleading image of Anne Bront&euml; was her older sister Charlotte, who became, in effect, her first biographer and critic. Since Anne&#39;s life is not well documented (only a handful of her letters and papers are extant), there has been an inevitable tendency to rely too much on information about her from reported and written statements by Charlotte. Many of these&mdash;particularly her lukewarm assessments of Anne&#39;s literary abilities and her frequent references to Anne&#39;s pensiveness, docility, and religious morbidity&mdash;were accepted for decades as absolute; now they are being weighed more carefully as Charlotte&#39;s objectivity as a witness and impartiality as a judge are cross-examined.\r\n\r\nSome of the undisputed facts about Anne Bront&euml; are that she was the youngest daughter of the Reverend Patrick and Maria Branwell Bront&euml;; that she was born in the northeastern county of Yorkshire, England; and that she spent her childhood and formative years in the Bront&euml;s&#39; family home&mdash;the parsonage on the outskirts of the remote village of Haworth. She received her formal education between 1835 and 1837 at Miss Margaret Wooler&#39;s boarding school. During Anne&#39;s attendance there, the school was relocated from Roe Head to Dewsbury Moor, near Leeds.\r\n\r\nStraitened family finances compelled Anne to search for employment, and between April and the latter part of 1839 she worked as a governess in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Ingham of Blake Hall. She occupied her second post as a governess to the three daughters of the Reverend and Mrs. Edmund Robinson of Thorp Green Hall, near York, for five years, beginning her duties in May 1840. Her brother, Branwell, joined her there in January 1843, when he was hired as tutor to the Robinsons&#39; only son, Edmund. The significance of this period of Anne Bront&euml;&#39;s life and the vital importance which it played in her education, her maturation, and her growing understanding of mankind should be neither overlooked nor underestimated. The Robinsons were wealthy and privileged and were related to people of importance (including a marquis and a member of Parliament); the social milieu in which they moved was wide and varied. It can be fairly assumed that Anne Bront&euml;, as a part of the Robinson household, came into contact with many of her employers&#39; relations and friends; she would have had ample opportunity to observe their behavior at close quarters, thus gaining insights into the ways of the world which would have eluded her had she remained in the relatively narrow confines of Haworth Parsonage. Unfortunately, Anne&#39;s main extant direct reference to Thorp Green Hall is extremely brief, tantalizingly pregnant with meaning, but frustratingly cryptic; it concludes with the enigmatic words: &quot;... during my stay I have had some very unpleasant and undreamt-of experience of human nature.&quot; After resigning in June 1845, she spent her few remaining years at Haworth with her father; her sisters, Charlotte and Emily; and her brother, Branwell; Emily and Branwell predeceased her in 1848.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, and until at least 1845, Anne and Emily (who were described as being &quot;like twins, inseparable companions in the very closest sympathy&quot;) collaborated in writing the saga of a fictitious island named Gondal. Although none of their Gondal prose has survived, a number of their Gondal poems do exist.\r\n\r\nA book of poems by Charlotte, Emily, and Anne, who used the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell respectively, appeared in 1846. Anne&#39;s first novel, Agnes Grey, was published in one of three volumes&mdash;the other two contained Emily&#39;s Wuthering Heights&mdash;in December 1847. Her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in June 1848.\r\n\r\nAnne Bront&euml;&#39;s books are primarily concerned with morality; she is preoccupied with the ethical principles which, for good or ill, govern human behavior. Her two novels present a closely observed, occasionally satirical, rarely humorous, and often melancholy view of what she regards as a profoundly imperfect world. Her prose frequently achieves elegance through its simplicity; her direct and didactic manner is tempered with a disarming sincerity, so that it succeeds in persuading rather than alienating the reader. The philosophy guiding her intent as a writer is that &quot;the end of Religion is not to teach us how to die, but how to live; and the earlier you become wise and good, the more of happiness you secure.&quot; Nevertheless, as the critic Terry Eagleton has observed, &quot;for such a resolutely moral writer, Anne Bront&euml; is remarkably unsmug.&quot;\r\n\r\nAgnes Grey is the novel in which, according to Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte&#39;s &quot;sister Anne pretty literally describes her own experience as a governess.&quot; This remark, which seems as much an oversimplification as saying that Villette (1853) is the novel in which Charlotte pretty literally describes own experience as a teacher in Brussels, has resulted in Agnes Grey being interpreted as a mere autobiography or diary&mdash;an estimation which does great disservice to Bront&euml;&#39;s abilities as an artificer. This erroneous view of the book is also due, in part, to a frequent misunderstanding of the mode in which it is written. Purporting to be a &quot;true history,&quot; it is in the tradition of the fictitious memoir which dates back to the eighteenth century and such novels as Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll Flanders  (1721). Indeed, the influence of Defoe and other writers of that period on Bront&euml; has been noted frequently. Moll Flanders claims to be a true history and, like  Agnes Grey, contains many references to its truthfulness and moral purpose. Moll&#39;s avowal that &quot;publishing this account of my life is for the sake of the just moral of every part of it, and for instruction, caution, warning, and improvement to every reader&quot; is closely echoed by Agnes Grey&#39;s claim that &quot;my design, in writing the last few pages, was not to amuse, but to benefit those whom it might concern,&quot; and by the phrase which begins the novel: &quot;All true histories contain instruction.&quot;\r\n\r\nBront&euml;&#39;s publicly declared purpose as a writer (stated in her preface&mdash;dated 22 July 1848&mdash;to the second edition of  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall) was &quot;to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it ... and if I can gain the public ear at all, I would rather whisper a few wholesome truths therein than much soft nonsense.&quot; Clearly, she intended to instruct, and she shrewdly chose the most appropriate form to achieve her goal; Inga-Stina Ewbank points out that &quot;for the purposes of instruction, truth is more impressive than fiction&mdash;hence her [Bront&euml;&#39;s] insistence on Agnes Grey being a genuine autobiography.&quot;\r\n\r\nBront&euml; does not analyze the workings of the human mind; rather, she writes in what F. R. Leavis has described, in another context, as &quot;the tradition coming down from the eighteenth century that demanded a plane-mirror reflection of the surface of &#39;real&#39; life.&quot; Consequently, she makes the reader form opinions of her fictional people by their actions rather than by the psychological forces which motivate those actions. She reveals the nature of her characters not so much by what they think as by what they say and do. The resulting effect bears a resemblance to a morality play&mdash;a world of black and white, right and wrong, in which only very occasionally is the conscience of a character torn between the polarities of good and evil.\r\n\r\nIn Agnes Grey, goodness is equated with adherence to a set of values which takes for granted the supreme importance of love and compassion for one&#39;s fellow man as stated in the tenets of Christianity; but such goodness is represented by only a tiny minority of characters in the book. Among them are Agnes herself; her father, an impoverished clergyman; her mother, who, by marrying Mr. Grey for love against the wishes of her wealthy parents, has cheerfully sacrificed a handsome inheritance and thus rejected materialism; and by Agnes&#39;s elder sister, Mary.\r\n\r\nIt is of great import that all the characters in the story for whom Agnes feels true affinity and respect are members of the poor and working classes; one of these is Edward Weston, a conscientious, underpaid curate of firm faith and ardent piety, whom Agnes marries in the final chapter. Through her sympathetic presentation of such people, juxtaposed with her unflattering and often satirical depiction of the hollow values of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy, Bront&euml; makes an unmistakable equation between wealth and moral bankruptcy. In its indictment of the conduct of the financially privileged members of Victorian England,  Agnes Grey qualifies as a novel of sociological as well as moral significance. It is also a novel about failure&mdash;a subtly cynical portrayal of the triumph of mediocrity over excellence.\r\n\r\nAgnes begins her career as a governess at the age of eighteen, with eager, almost naive anticipation: &quot;how charming to be entrusted with the care and education of children ... to train the tender plants, and watch their buds unfolding day by day!&quot; But chapter two (which has the splendidly ironic title &quot;First Lessons in the Art of Instruction&quot;) marks the beginning of Agnes&#39;s disillusionment; soon after initial contact with her first pupils, she becomes conscious of &quot;a vicious tendency in the bud.&quot; The rest of the story depicts her varied, valiant, but futile attempts to combat the callousness, selfishness, vanity, greed, cruelty, and indifference of her employers and her young charges.\r\n\r\nThe human failings (and their unhappy consequences) which Agnes so clearly deplores are most effectively demonstrated in the career of her oldest pupil, Rosalie Murray. Agnes&#39;s evaluation of her is clear-sighted but compassionate: &quot;her faults ... I would fain persuade myself, were rather the effect of her education than her disposition: she had never been perfectly taught the distinction between right and wrong.&quot; With the connivance of her unscrupulous and ambitious mother, Rosalie exchanges her idle career as a heartless coquette for a marriage of convenience to a wealthy, aristocratic, but debauched man, Sir Thomas Ashby. In her eagerness to become the mistress of Ashby Park, Rosalie rationalizes that &quot;reformed rakes make the best husbands, everybody knows.&quot; Agnes Grey knows better!\r\n\r\nAgnes&#39;s own marriage to Edward Weston serves as a modest rather than triumphant conclusion to the novel; he is a vaguely sketched, particularly one-dimensional character, and her union with him seems to be Bront&euml;&#39;s nod in the direction of the traditional happy ending. In dramatic terms, the event is anticlimactic and at variance with the powerful sense of disillusionment which pervades two chapters near the end of the novel, when Agnes pays her final visit to Rosalie. Having confided to Agnes that she now despises her rich, dissipated husband, Rosalie is reluctant to let her former governess go. The following excerpt from chapter twenty-three demonstrates, in style, the clarity of Bront&euml;&#39;s prose; in content, it testifies to the author&#39;s tacit acknowledgment of the predominantly melancholy nature of the human condition: &quot;it was with a heavy heart that I bade adieu to poor Lady Ashby, and left her in her princely home. It was no slight additional proof of her unhappiness, that she should so cling to the consolation of my presence, and earnestly desire the company of one whose general tastes and ideas were so little congenial to her own&mdash;whom she had completely forgotten in her hours of prosperity, and whose presence would be rather a nuisance than a pleasure, if she could but have half her heart&#39;s desire.&quot; The supreme irony of this often ironic novel is that it is Agnes&mdash;a teacher by instinct and profession&mdash;who learns how to come to terms with life. She is the pupil who says &quot;I had been seasoned by adversity, and tutored by experience,&quot; and who, as a result, formulates the simple but sound philosophy that &quot;the best way to enjoy yourself is to do what is right and hate nobody.&quot; Her ultimate defeat is that she has failed to educate others to share that philosophy. Why the author allowed this defeat is better understood if one recalls that elsewhere Bront&euml; qualified her contention that &quot;truth always conveys its own moral&quot; by adding the artfully sardonic phrase: &quot;to those who are able to receive it.&quot;\r\n\r\nAgnes Grey was received quite warmly when it appeared in 1847, but being published as part of a &quot;three-decker&quot; with Wuthering Heights was definitely not to its advantage. Emily&#39;s novel had a mixed reception: it was generally misunderstood and considered &quot;coarse&quot;&mdash;as, indeed, were all the early Bront&euml; novels when they were first presented to the public&mdash;but its strangeness and eccentricities made good copy. Consequently, it got the attention, if not necessarily the praise, of the critics. The inevitable comparisons were made, and Agnes Grey&mdash;by its very nature&mdash;appeared &quot;less powerful.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe major preoccupation of Bront&euml;&#39;s other novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848), is very much the same as that of Agnes Grey, but the war between good and evil is waged on a considerably larger battleground. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is much longer than its predecessor, and more complex in structure, scope, and the number of characters it contains.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that Agnes Grey influenced the composition of Jane Eyre, and close examination shows that they contain a considerable number of similarities in &quot;cast of thought, incident and language.&quot; For example, Agnes&#39;s &quot;marked features,&quot; &quot;pale hollow cheek,&quot; and &quot;ordinary dark brown hair&quot; anticipate Jane Eyre&#39;s unprepossessing physical appearance. (Traditionally, it is Charlotte, not Anne, who has been credited with the introduction of the irreversibly plain heroine to English fiction.)\r\n\r\nAlso, there are indications that  Wuthering Heights influenced the subsequent composition of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. The two books have a number of similarities, including an unusual degree of passionate intensity (in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, this is particularly evident in the vehemence of which Gilbert Markham is capable). George Moore commented that Anne Bront&euml; &quot;could write with heat, one of the rarest qualities&quot;&mdash;but it is a quality conspicuous by its absence in Agnes Grey.Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall also show similarities in construction, such as the device of employing double narrators&mdash;Mr. Lockwood and Ellen Dean in Wuthering Heights; in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Gilbert Markham and Helen Huntingdon.\r\n\r\nGilbert&mdash;a gentleman farmer&mdash;falls in love with Helen, the enigmatic tenant of Wildfell Hall, who is presumed to be a widow. She is, in fact, the estranged wife of the alcoholic and lecherous Arthur Huntingdon. Gilbert&#39;s narrative, in the early chapters, skillfully maintains the air of mystery which surrounds Helen and demonstrates his growing attachment to her. This narrative, which begins and ends the novel, is contained in a series of letters (the form bears some resemblance to Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein [1818]). Gilbert&#39;s letters provide the framework for a transcript of Helen&#39;s diary, which she has given to Gilbert to help him understand the trials of her past life. This diary, containing a graphic account of her optimistic entry into marriage with Huntingdon and of the gradual disintegration of that marriage brought about by his debauchery, occupies the central and major part of the novel.\r\n\r\nArthur Huntingdon and his cronies are forcefully portrayed; the depths of depravity to which they are capable of sinking is demonstrated in some remarkably vivid and lurid scenes, and there has been some speculation that Bront&euml;&#39;s inspiration for such incidents could have come from her years at Thorp Green Hall. Charlotte Bront&euml; claimed that Anne &quot;had, in the course of her life, been called on to contemplate, near at hand, and for a long time, the terrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused.&quot; The reference is to their brother, Branwell&#39;s, refuge in alcohol and drugs following his abrupt dismissal from his post as tutor at Thorp Green Hall. To the end of his life, Branwell adhered to his assertion that the cause of that dismissal was the discovery by his employer, the Reverend Edmund Robinson, of a clandestine love affair between Branwell and Robinson&#39;s wife, Lydia. The suggestion that Anne may have been an unwilling witness to this liaison is interesting but refutable; what is beyond dispute is that she closely observed the ravaging effects that gin and laudanum had on the mind and body of her brother.\r\n\r\nHelen Huntingdon&#39;s diary effectively demonstrates her gradual metamorphosis from an optimistic, eager young girl&mdash;convinced that she can reform her rakish, irresponsible husband&mdash;into a mature, somewhat cynical, worldly-wise woman. It depicts her long, arduous struggle to persuade the man she loves to heed the principles of Christianity in order to overcome his many weaknesses and to live a life that will lead to salvation, not degradation. Helen, like Agnes Grey, is highly principled and deeply religious; also like Agnes, she is a teacher by instinct. Helen firmly believes that &quot;it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their transgressions&quot;; and when speaking of her son, Helen states that &quot;the child&#39;s education was the only pleasure and business of my life.&quot; Plainly, she is adamant that the son will not emulate the behavior of the father, and that he will be &quot;perfectly taught the distinction between right and wrong.&quot;\r\n\r\nUnlike Agnes, she is not a teacher by profession; she is, in fact, a member of the privileged classes. Consequently, compared with Agnes, she is much more openly self-assured and composed. Bront&euml; succeeds admirably in convincing the reader of the air of elegance in Helen&#39;s demeanor and the element of self-reliance in her conduct (which strongly hints of feminism). In the words addressed by Helen to her enemies (including her husband&#39;s shallow mistress, Annabella Wilmot), Bront&euml; employs a grand style of language which is reminiscent in its imperious tone of the prose in wrathful letters of the first Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nAlthough The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, like Agnes Grey, has a conventional happy ending (Huntingdon dies as the result of his excesses, and after a respectable lapse of time, Helen marries Gilbert), it, too, is a novel about defeat. Ultimately, the significance of the marriages of Helen and Agnes to men who love them pales beside the facts that Helen has failed to save Arthur Huntingdon and that Agnes has failed to save Rosalie Murray. Both books have overtones of despair, reflecting Bront&euml;&#39;s bleak but realistic and unflinching view of the world.\r\n\r\nThe reviews of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall in the summer of 1848 were varied; an accusation that the author had &quot;a morbid love for the coarse, not to say the brutal&quot; was echoed in several quarters, but the book was recommended by the Athenaeum as &quot;the most interesting novel we have read for a month past.&quot; A flurry of public interest led to a hurried printing of a second edition in August with a preface by the author&mdash;the final words she wrote specifically for publication. Bront&euml; was bold and defiant in her response to a critic who had suggested that if The Tenant of Wildfell Hall had been written by a woman, that fact would make it even more unpalatable to him: &quot;in my own mind, I am satisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.&quot;\r\n\r\nCharlotte Bront&euml; was disturbed by The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and made no secret of her distaste for the book. In her &quot;Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell&quot; (1850), she referred to the fact that Anne&#39;s second novel had had a predominantly unfavorable reception: &quot;At this I cannot wonder. The choice of subject was an entire mistake. Nothing less congruous with the writer&#39;s nature could be conceived. The motives which dictated this choice were pure, but, I think, slightly morbid.&quot; Thus, in September 1850, in her influential position as one of the most lionized writers of her time, Charlotte Bront&euml; helped to quell interest in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by publicly condemning it. Privately, during the same month, she sealed the fate of Anne&#39;s second novel by declining Smith, Elder&#39;s offer to issue a reprint edition, saying, &quot;Wildfell Hall it hardly appears to me desireable to preserve.&quot; Less than seven years later, in her Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;, Mrs. Gaskell&#39;s brief reference to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall included this telling phrase: &quot;it is little known.&quot;\r\n\r\nDuring her brief and seemingly circumscribed life, Anne Bront&euml; only once ventured outside her home county of Yorkshire; the occasion was a fleeting visit to London with Charlotte in July 1848, an incident now renowned in the annals of English literature&mdash;it has even found a niche in the Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes! The purpose of this urgent, hurried journey was to disprove the rumors then rampant (and unscrupulously fueled by Anne&#39;s and Emily&#39;s publisher T. C. Newby in order to capitalize on the astonishing current success of Charlotte&#39;s Jane Eyre) that Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell were not three authors but one. Determined to disassociate themselves from this falsehood, Anne and Charlotte gained entry to the Cornhill office of Charlotte&#39;s publisher George Smith, who had no knowledge of the Bells&#39; true identities or of their gender; there, Charlotte startled him with the dramatic declaration, &quot;We are three sisters.&quot;\r\n\r\nMany years later, George Smith recorded his impressions of Anne, based on that very brief meeting with her; he said, &quot;She was a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy.&quot; Although &quot;of a pleasing appearance,&quot; Anne had no serious suitors during her lifetime; however, it has been suggested by some biographers&mdash;and avowed by others&mdash;that she was in love with William Weightman, an attractive, exuberant young man who served as the Reverend Patrick Bront&euml;&#39;s curate from August 1839 until his death from cholera in September 1842. The evidence to support this theory is flimsy and is based primarily on a remark in a letter written by Charlotte: &quot;He [Weightman] sits opposite to Anne at Church sighing softly and looking out of the corners of his eyes to win her attention&mdash;and Anne is so quiet, her looks so downcast&mdash;they are a picture.&quot; The significance of this statement is severely undermined by observations about Weightman made by Charlotte in other letters, which clearly demonstrate her opinion of him as an inveterate flirt; she says, among other things, &quot;I&#39;m afraid he is very fickle&quot; and &quot;He would fain persuade every woman under thirty whom he sees that he is desperately in love with her.&quot; It appears that Weightman did not feel strongly about Anne; the conjecture that she felt strongly about him is based on several of her poems, written after September 1842&mdash;including A Reminiscence (1844) and Severed and Gone (1847)&mdash;which lament the death of a loved one and which may be autobiographical in nature. No other romantic connections are alleged for Anne; she received no recorded offers of marriage, and she died a spinster at the age of twenty-nine. Her death, from tuberculosis, took place at the coastal resort of Scarborough.\r\n\r\nEighty years separated Anne&#39;s death from W. T. Hale&#39;s Anne Bront&euml;: Her Life and Writings (1929), the first publication to treat her as more than a peripheral player in the Bront&euml; story and to challenge some of the myths which had surrounded &quot;dear, gentle Anne.&quot; In his sympathetic, often astute monograph, Hale firmly states: &quot;The truth about her is that her gentleness was not weakness. Childlike and unsophisticated in many ways she was, but she had a power of will and a strength of character that always carried out the dictates of her sense of duty.&quot; Professor Hale&#39;s point of view was innovative; and by choosing to focus his attention on Anne, he created a precedent. Since then, a number of prominent critics have deemed Anne Bront&euml; and her work to be worthy of serious consideration. The result of this re-evaluation has been a growing conviction that she is a minor but worthwhile nineteenth-century novelist who, although admittedly less gifted than her sisters, demonstrates a considerable degree of individuality, originality, and even daring in her modest but far from negligible output.\r\n\r\nF. B. Pinion&#39;s contention that &quot;there can be little doubt that, had The Tenant of Wildfell Hall received more critical attention, its merits would be more widely recognised,&quot; can be applied with equal validity to Agnes Grey. The 1979 publication of a carefully edited edition of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall in the Penguin English Library and the appearance in the same year of The Poems of Anne Bront&euml;: A New Text and Commentary by Edward Chitham are encouraging signs that there is indeed a growing trend to regard Anne&#39;s work in a fresh and positive light. There can be no doubt that as her books are more widely read&mdash;with care and attention&mdash;there will be a commensurate acknowledgment and appreciation for what she achieved during her brief but productive life., Anne Bront\u00eb  ( / \u02c8 b r \u0252 n t i / ,  commonly   /- t e\u026a / ; [1]  17 January 1820 \u2013 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, the youngest member of the  Bront\u00eb literary family .Anne Bront\u00eb was the daughter of  Maria  ( n\u00e9e  Branwell) and  Patrick Bront\u00eb , a poor Irish clergyman in the  Church of England . Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of  Haworth  on the Yorkshire moors. Otherwise, she attended a boarding school in  Mirfield  between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846  she published  a book of poems with her sisters  and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel,  Agnes Grey , was published in 1847 at the same time as  Wuthering Heights  by her sister  Emily Bront\u00eb . Anne\u2019s second novel,  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall , was published in 1848.  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall  is often considered one of the first  feminist  novels. [2]Anne died at 29, most likely of  pulmonary tuberculosis . After her death, her sister  Charlotte  edited  Agnes Grey  to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . As a result, Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless, both of her novels are considered classics of  English literature .Anne's father was  Patrick Bront\u00eb  (1777\u20131861). Patrick Bront\u00eb was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale,  Loughbrickland ,  County Down , Ireland. [3] [4]  He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers. [5]  The family surname,  mac Aedh \u00d3 Proinntigh , was  Anglicised  as Prunty or Brunty. [3]  Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at  St. John's College, Cambridge . Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Bront\u00eb. In 1807, he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England. [6]  He served as a  curate  in Essex and then in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810, he published his first poem,  Winter Evening Thoughts , in a local newspaper. [7]  In 1811, he published a collection of moral verse,  Cottage Poems . [8]  Also in 1811, he became vicar of St. Peter's Church in  Hartshead , Yorkshire. [9]  In 1812, he was appointed an examiner in Classics at  Woodhouse Grove School , near  Bradford . This was a  Wesleyan  academy where, at 35, he met his future wife, the headmaster's niece,  Maria Branwell .Maria Branwell (1783\u20131821), Anne's mother, was the daughter of Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith, and Thomas Branwell, a successful and property-owning grocer and tea merchant in  Penzance . [10]  Maria was the eleventh of twelve children and enjoyed the benefits of a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents, Maria went to help her aunt with housekeeping functions at the school. Maria was intelligent and well read, [11]  and her strong  Methodist  faith attracted Patrick Bront\u00eb, whose own leanings were similar. [12]Within three months, on 29 December 1812, though from considerably different backgrounds, Patrick Bront\u00eb and Maria Branwell were married. [13]  Their first child, Maria (1814\u20131825), was born after they moved to  Hartshead . In 1815, Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in Market Street  Thornton , near  Bradford . A second daughter, Elizabeth (1815\u20131825), was born shortly after. [14]  Four more children followed:  Charlotte  (1816\u20131855),  Patrick Branwell  (1817\u20131848),  Emily  (1818\u20131848), and Anne (1820\u20131849).Anne was the youngest of the Bront\u00eb children. She was born on 17 January 1820 at the parsonage in Market Street,  Thornton  (now known as the  Bront\u00eb Birthplace ), on the outskirts of  Bradford . [15]  Her father, Patrick, was curate there. Anne was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Later Patrick was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town seven miles (11 km) away. In April 1820 the family moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage.When Anne was barely a year old her mother, Maria, became ill, probably with  uterine cancer . [16]  Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. [17]  Patrick tried to remarry, without success. [18]  Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776\u20131842), had moved to the parsonage initially for Maria, but spent the rest of her life there raising Maria's children. She did it from a sense of duty. She was stern and expected respect, not love. [19]  There was little affection between her and the older children. According to tradition Anne was her favourite.In  Elizabeth Gaskell 's biography of Charlotte, Patrick remembered Anne as precocious. Patrick said that when Anne was four years old he had asked her what a child most wanted and that she had said: \"age and experience\". [20]In summer 1824 Patrick sent daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily to Crofton Hall in  Crofton, West Yorkshire , and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter's School at  Cowan Bridge  in Lancashire. [21]  Maria and Elizabeth Bront\u00eb died of  tuberculosis  on 6 May and 15 June 1825 respectively, and Charlotte and Emily were brought home. [20]  The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. They were educated at home for the next five years, largely by Elizabeth Branwell and Patrick. [22]  The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage and relied on each other for company. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, Elizabeth. They were close, and she may have influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs. [23]Anne's studies at home included music and drawing. The Keighley church organist gave piano lessons to Anne and Emily and Branwell, and John Bradley of Keighley gave them art lessons. Each drew with some skill. [24]  Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but they inclined more to literature. [25]  They read much from their father's well-stocked library. Their reading included the Bible,  Homer ,  Virgil ,  Shakespeare ,  Milton ,  Byron ,  Scott , articles from  Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine  and  Fraser's Magazine  and  The Edinburgh Review , and miscellaneous books of history and geography and biography. [26]Their reading fed their imaginations, and their creativity soared after their father gave Branwell a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave names to the soldiers, or the \"Twelves\", [27]  and developed their characters. This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of \" Angria \", which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, \"Glass Town\", later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis. [28]Their fantastical worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired characteristics from their historical world, drawing from its sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools, and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children were given newspapers and magazines and chronicles written in tiny books with writing so small that it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later literary talents. [29]Around 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, \" Gondal \". Anne and Emily were particularly close, especially after Charlotte left for Roe Head School in January 1831. [30]  Charlotte's friend  Ellen Nussey  visited Haworth in 1833 and reported that Emily and Anne were \"like twins\" and \"inseparable companions\". She described Anne so:Anne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt's favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt. [31] [32]Anne took lessons from Charlotte after Charlotte had returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835, accompanied by Emily as a pupil. Emily's tuition was largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Emily was unable to adapt to life at school and was physically ill from homesickness within a few months. She was withdrawn from school by October and replaced by Anne.Anne was 15 and it was her first time away from home. She made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hardworking and determined to stay to acquire the education which she would need to support herself. [33] [34]  She stayed for two years and returned home only during Christmas and summer holidays. She won a good-conduct medal in December 1836. Charlotte's letters almost never mention Anne while Anne was at Roe Head, which might imply that they were not close, but Charlotte was at least concerned about Anne's health. By December 1837 Anne had become seriously ill with  gastritis  and embroiled in religious crisis. [35]  A  Moravian  minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. [ clarification needed ]  Charlotte wrote to their father and he brought Anne home.A year after leaving the school, and aged 19, Anne was seeking a teaching position. She was the daughter of a poor clergyman and needed to earn money. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as a governess were among few options for a poor and educated woman. In April 1839 Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near  Mirfield . [37]The children in her charge were spoiled and disobedient. [38]  Anne had great difficulty controlling them and little success in educating them. She was not allowed to punish them, and when she complained about their behaviour she received no support and was criticised for being incapable. The Inghams were dissatisfied with their children's progress and dismissed Anne. [39]  She returned home in 1839 at Christmas. At home also were Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. Anne's time at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect [ clarification needed ]  detail in her novel  Agnes Grey .Anne returned to Haworth and met William Weightman (1814\u20131842), her father's new curate who had started work in the parish in August 1839. [40]  Weightman was 25 and had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the  University of Durham . He was welcome at the parsonage. Anne's acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him [41] [42] [ clarification needed ]  although there is disagreement over this possibility. [43]  Little evidence exists beyond a small anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842. [ clarification needed ]In  Agnes Grey , Agnes' interest in the curate refreshes her interest in poetry. Outside fiction,  William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems that he was good-looking and engaging, and that his easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made an impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing. [44] [ clarification needed ]Weightman died of cholera in the same year. [45]  Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem  I will not mourn thee, lovely one , in which she called him \"our darling\". [40]From 1840 to 1845 Anne worked at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near  York . Here she was governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife, Lydia. [47] [48]  The house appeared as Horton Lodge in  Agnes Grey . Anne had four pupils: Lydia (15), Elizabeth (13), Mary (12), and Edmund (8). [49]  She initially had problems similar to those at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family. In a diary paper in 1841 she wrote that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet and gentle disposition did not help. [50]  But Anne was determined and made a success of her position, becoming well-liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.Anne spent only five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons. She accompanied the Robinsons on annual holidays to  Scarborough . Between 1840 and 1844 Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved it. [51]  A number of locations in Scarborough were used for her novels. She had opportunities to collect semi-precious stones, [52]  considering an interest in geology, at least  in her novels, [53]  or from personal experience, as something suitable for men and women to be considered as equals. [54]Anne and her sisters considered setting up a school while she was still working for the Robinsons. Various locations were considered, including the parsonage, but the project never materialised. Anne came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels. [55]  Elizabeth Branwell left a \u00a3350 legacy (equivalent to \u00a340,000 in 2021) [56]  for each of her nieces. [57]It was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem  Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day , which was published in 1846 under the name Acton Bell. [58]In January 1843 Anne returned to Thorp Green and secured a position for Branwell. He was to tutor Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination. [59] [ clarification needed ]  All three Bront\u00eb sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness, but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work. [60]Anne and Branwell taught at Thorp Green for the next three years. Branwell entered into a secret relationship with his employer's wife, Lydia Robinson. [ clarification needed ]  When Anne and Branwell returned home for the holidays in June 1845 Anne resigned. [61]  Anne gave no reason, but the reason may have been the relationship between her brother and Mrs Robinson. [62] [ clarification needed ]  Branwell was dismissed when his employer found out about the relationship. Anne continued to exchange letters with Elizabeth and Mary Robinson. They came to visit Anne in December 1848. [63]Anne took Emily to visit some of the places which Anne had become fond of. A plan to visit  Scarborough  fell through, but they went to  York  and saw  York Minster . [64]The Bront\u00ebs were at home with their father during the summer of 1845. None had any immediate prospect of employment. Charlotte found Emily's poems, which had been shared only with Anne. Charlotte said that they should be published. Anne showed her own poems to Charlotte, and Charlotte \"thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own\". [65] [66]  The sisters eventually reached an agreement. [ clarification needed ]  They told nobody what they were doing. With the money from Elizabeth Branwell they paid for publication of a collection of poems, 21 from Anne and 21 from Emily and 19 from Charlotte. [60]The book was published under  pen names  which retained their initials but concealed their sex. [67]  Anne's pseudonym was Acton Bell.  Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell  was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was 31 pounds and 10 shillings, about three-quarters of Anne's salary at Thorp Green. [68] [69]  On 7 May 1846 the first three copies were delivered to Haworth Parsonage. [70]  The book achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a commercial failure, with only two copies sold in the first year. Anne nonetheless found a market for her later poetry. The  Leeds Intelligencer  and  Fraser's Magazine  published her poem  The Narrow Way  under her pseudonym in December 1848. Four months earlier, Fraser's Magazine had published her poem  The Three Guides .By July 1846 a package containing the manuscripts of each sister's first novel was making the rounds of London publishers. Charlotte had written  The Professor , Emily had written  Wuthering Heights , and Anne had written  Agnes Grey .After some rejections  Wuthering Heights  and  Agnes Grey  were accepted by the publisher  Thomas Cautley Newby .  The Professor  was rejected. [71]  It was not long before Charlotte had completed her second novel,  Jane Eyre .  Jane Eyre  was accepted immediately by  Smith, Elder & Co.  It was the first published of the sisters' novels, and an immediate and resounding success. Meanwhile, Anne and Emily's novels \"lingered in the press\". Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher was galvanised by the success of  Jane Eyre  and published  Wuthering Heights  and  Agnes Grey  together in December 1847. [72]  They sold well, but  Agnes Grey  was outshone by Emily's more dramatic  Wuthering Heights . [73]\"Sick of mankind and their disgusting ways,\" scribbled Anne Bront\u00eb in pencil at the back of her Prayer Book.Stevie Davies ,  Introduction  in  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall , Penguin Classics.Anne's second novel,  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall , was published in the last week of June 1848. [75]The novel challenged contemporary social and legal structures. In 1913  May Sinclair  said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. [76]In the book Helen has left her husband to protect their son from his influence. She supports herself and her son in hiding by painting. She has violated social conventions and English law. Until the  Married Women's Property Act 1870  was passed, a married woman had no legal existence independent from her husband and could not own property nor sue for  divorce  nor control the custody of her children. Helen's husband had a right to reclaim her and charge her with kidnapping. By subsisting on her own income she was stealing her husband's property since this income was legally his. [60]Anne stated her intentions in the second edition, published in August 1848. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (among them Charlotte) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing. Anne \"wished to tell the truth\". She explained further thatWhen we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear. To represent a bad thing in its least offensive light is doubtless the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the safest? Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and flowers? O Reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of facts \u2013 this whispering 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace, [77]  there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience. [78]Anne also castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of authors and the perceived appropriateness of their writing. She wassatisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man. [79]In July 1848 Anne and Charlotte went to Charlotte's publisher  George Smith  in London to dispel the rumour that the \"Bell brothers\" were one person. Emily refused to go. Anne and Charlotte spent several days with Smith. Many years after Anne's death, he wrote in the  Cornhill Magazine  his impressions of her:a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy. [80]The increasing popularity of the Bells' works led to renewed interest in  Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell , originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.Branwell's persistent drunkenness disguised the decline of his health and he died on 24 September 1848. [81]  His sudden death shocked the family. He was 31. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis \u2013  marasmus , [ clarification needed ]  but was probably  tuberculosis . [82]The family suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848, and Emily became very ill. She worsened over two months and rejected medical aid until the morning of 19 December. [ clarification needed ]  She was very weak and said that \"if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now\". [83]  But Emily died at about two o'clock that afternoon, aged 30. [83]Emily's death deeply affected Anne. Her grief undermined her physical health. [84]  Over Christmas Anne had influenza. Her symptoms intensified and in early January her father sent for a  Leeds  physician. The doctor diagnosed advanced  consumption  with little hope of recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control. [85] [ clarification needed ]  However, in her letter to Ellen Nussey she expressed her frustrated ambitions:I have no horror of death: if I thought it inevitable I think I could quietly resign myself to the prospect ... But I wish it would please God to spare me not only for Papa's and Charlotte's sakes but because I long to do some good in the world before I leave it. I have many schemes in my head for future practise \u2013 humble and limited indeed \u2013 but still I should not like them all to come to nothing, and myself to have lived to so little purpose. But God's will be done. [86]Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines and followed the advice she was given. [87]  That same month [ clarification needed ]  she wrote her last poem,  A dreadful darkness closes in , in which she deals with being terminally ill. [88]  Her health fluctuated for months, but she grew thinner and weaker.Anne seemed somewhat better in February. [89]  She decided to visit Scarborough to see if the change of location and the fresh sea air might benefit her. [90]  Charlotte was initially against the journey, fearing that it would be too stressful, but changed her mind after the doctor's approval and Anne's assurance that it was her last hope. [86]On 24 May 1849, Anne set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and  Ellen Nussey . They spent a day and night in York en route. Here they escorted Anne in a wheelchair and did some shopping and visited  York Minster . It was clear that Anne had little strength left.On Sunday 27 May, Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier to return home and die instead of remaining in Scarborough. A doctor was consulted the next day and said that death was close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and whispered for Charlotte to \"take courage\". [91]  Anne died at about two o'clock in the afternoon on Monday 28 May 1849, aged 29.Charlotte decided to \"lay the flower where it had fallen\". [82]  So Anne was buried in Scarborough. The funeral was held on 30 May. Patrick Bront\u00eb could not have made the 70-mile (110 km) journey if he had wished to. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough, and she was the only other mourner at Anne's funeral. [92] [ clarification needed ]  Anne was buried in  St Mary's  churchyard, beneath the castle walls and overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave with the inscription,Here lie the remains of Anne Bront\u00eb, daughter of the Revd P. Bront\u00eb, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died Aged 28 May 28th 1849.When Charlotte visited the grave three years later she discovered multiple errors on the headstone and had it refaced, but it was still not free of error, for Anne was 29 when she died, not 28 as written.In 2011 the  Bront\u00eb Society  installed a new plaque at Anne Bront\u00eb's grave. The original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored. It was left undisturbed while the new plaque was laid horizontally, interpreting the fading words of the original and correcting its error. [93]  In April 2013 the Bront\u00eb Society held a dedication and blessing service at the gravesite to mark the installation of the new plaque. [94] [95]After Anne's death, Charlotte addressed issues with the first edition of  Agnes Grey  for its republication, but she prevented republication of  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . [96]  In 1850 Charlotte wrote thatWildfell Hall  it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer. [97]Subsequent critics paid less attention to Anne's work and some dismissed her as \"a Bront\u00eb without genius\". [98]But since the mid-20th century her life and works have been given better attention. Biographies by  Winifred G\u00e9rin  (1959), Elizabeth Langland (1989) and Edward Chitham (1991), as well as Juliet Barker's group biography,  The Bront\u00ebs  (1994; revised edition 2000), and work by critics such as  Inga-Stina Ewbank , Marianne Thorm\u00e4hlen, Laura C Berry, Jan B Gordon, Mary Summers, and Juliet McMaster has led to acceptance of Anne Bront\u00eb as a major literary figure. [85] [99]  Sally McDonald of the Bront\u00eb Society said in 2013 that in some ways Anne \"is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women's need to maintain independence and how alcoholism can tear a family apart.\" [95]  In 2016  Lucy Mangan  championed Anne Bront\u00eb in the BBC's  Being the Bront\u00ebs , declaring that \"her time has come\".

Anne's mother died of uterine cancer when she was just a year old, and two of her older sisters passed away from tuberculosis in 1824. Anne grew up in Haworth, a small town in Yorkshire, where her father served as the local curate.

However, her health was not robust, and she persevered through various ailments. After completing her studies, she worked as a governess for two families between 1839 and 1845. During this period, she experienced the challenges of managing unruly children and unsupportive employers, which would later inspire her first novel.\n\nAnne's literary career began in 1846 when Charlotte arranged for the publication of poems by the three sisters under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.

The novel received mixed reviews, with some critics finding it too moralizing, while others praised its realism and social commentary.\n\n\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\" Anne's second novel, is considered one of the first feminist novels. It tells the story of Helen Graham, a young woman who escapes her abusive husband and establishes an independent life for herself and her son. The novel explores themes of alcoholism, domestic violence, and women's rights, and it generated significant controversy upon its release. Some critics found its depiction of alcoholism and marital strife too explicit, while others praised its powerful message.\n\nAnne's literary career was cut short by her untimely death from tuberculosis on May 28, 1849, at the age of 29.

        "reflected_response": "\nResponse: Anne Bront\u00eb, the renowned English novelist and poet, led a brief but remarkable life. Born on January 17, 1820, in Thornton, England, she was the youngest of six children. Her childhood was marked by tragedy, as her mother, Maria Branwell Bront\u00eb, died of uterine cancer when Anne was only a year old, and two of her sisters succumbed to tuberculosis in 1824.

She is a celebrated  diarist  who described everyday life from her family hiding place in an  Amsterdam  attic. One of the most-discussed Jewish victims of  the Holocaust , she gained fame posthumously with the 1947 publication of  The Diary of a Young Girl  (originally  Het Achterhuis  in Dutch,  lit. \u2009 'the back house'; English:  The Secret Annex ), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 \u2014 it is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and  films .Frank was born in  Frankfurt , Germany, in 1929. In 1934, when she was four-and-a-half, she and her family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, after  Adolf Hitler  and the Nazi Party gained control over  Germany . She spent most of her life in or around Amsterdam. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the  German occupation of the Netherlands . Anne lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became  stateless . Despite spending most of her life in the Netherlands and being a  de facto  Dutch national, [2]  she never officially became a  Dutch citizen . As  persecutions of the Jewish population  increased in July 1942, they went into hiding in  concealed rooms  behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father,  Otto Frank , worked. The hiding place is notably referred to as the \" secret annex \". Until the family's arrest by the  Gestapo  on 4 August 1944, Frank kept and regularly wrote in a diary she had received as a birthday present in 1942.Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to  concentration camps . On 1 November 1944, [3]  Frank and her sister,  Margot , were transferred from  Auschwitz  to  Bergen-Belsen concentration camp , where they died (presumably of  typhus ) a few months later. They were estimated by the  Red Cross  to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as the official date. Later research has alternatively suggested that they may have died in February or early March.Otto, the only survivor of the Frank family, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that Anne's diary had been saved by his female secretaries,  Miep Gies  and  Bep Voskuijl . He decided to fulfil his daughter's greatest wish to become a writer. He published her diary in 1947. [4]  It was translated from its original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as  The Diary of a Young Girl , and has since been translated into over 70 languages. [5]Frank was born Annelies [6]  or Anneliese [7]  Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the  Maingau Red Cross Clinic [8]  in  Frankfurt , Germany, to  Edith  ( n\u00e9e  Holl\u00e4nder ) and  Otto Heinrich Frank . She had an older sister,  Margot . [9]  The Franks were  liberal Jews , and did not practice all of the customs and traditions of Judaism. [10]  They lived in an  assimilated  community of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of various religions. Edith and Otto were devoted parents, who were interested in scholarly pursuits and had an extensive library; both parents encouraged the children to read. [11] [12]  At the time of Anne's birth, the family lived in a house at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt- Dornbusch , where they rented two floors. In 1931, the family moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Dornbusch, called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter). Both houses still exist. [13]In 1933, after  Adolf Hitler 's  Nazi Party  won the  federal election  and Hitler was appointed  Chancellor of the Reich , Edith Frank and the children went to stay with Edith's mother Rosa in  Aachen . Otto Frank remained in Frankfurt, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, he moved there to organize the business and to arrange accommodation for his family. [14]  He began working at the  Opekta Works , a company that sold the fruit extract  pectin . Edith travelled back and forth between Aachen and Amsterdam and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the  Rivierenbuurt  neighbourhood of Amsterdam, where many more Jewish-German refugees settled. [15]  In November 1933, Edith followed her husband and a month later Margot moved to Amsterdam. [16]  Anne stayed with her grandmother until February, when the family reunited in Amsterdam. [17]  The Franks were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939. [18]After moving to Amsterdam, Anne and Margot Frank were enrolled in school\u2014Margot in public school and Anne in the  6th Montessori School . Anne joined the  6th Montessori School  on 9 April 1934; in 1957, it was posthumously renamed \"Anne Frank School\". [19] [20] [21]  Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil in Amsterdam. Anne soon felt at home at the  Montessori school  and met children of her own age, like  Hanneli Goslar , who would later become one of her best friends. [22]In 1938, Otto Frank started a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs,  pickling salts , and  mixed spices , used in the production of sausages. [23] [24]   Hermann van Pels  was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, he had fled  Osnabr\u00fcck  with his family. [24]  In 1939, Edith Frank's mother came to live with the Franks, and remained with them until her death in January 1942. [25]In May 1940, Germany  invaded the Netherlands , and the occupation government began to persecute Jews by the implementation of restrictive and discriminatory laws; mandatory registration and  segregation  soon followed. [25]  Otto Frank tried to arrange for the family to emigrate to the United States\u2014the only destination that seemed to him to be viable [26] \u2014but Frank's application for a visa was never processed, [27]  because the U.S. consulate in  Rotterdam  was destroyed in the  German bombing  on 14 May 1940, resulting in the loss of all the paperwork there, including the family's visa application. [28] [ unreliable source? ]After the summer holidays in 1941, Anne learned that she would no longer be allowed to go to the Montessori School, as Jewish children had to attend Jewish schools. From then on Anne, like her sister Margot, went to the  Jewish Lyceum  [ nl ]  ( Joods Lyceum ), [29]  an exclusive Jewish secondary school in Amsterdam opened in September 1941. [30]For her thirteenth birthday on 12 June 1942, Anne received an  autograph book , [31]  bound with red-and-white checkered cloth [32]  and with a small lock on the front. Frank decided she would use it as a diary, [33]  and had named it Kitty. She began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the  Dutch Jewish  population. [34]In mid-1942, the systematic deportation of Jews from the Netherlands started. [35]  Otto and Edith Frank planned to go into hiding with the children on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the  Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung  ( Central Office for Jewish Emigration ) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp, they were forced to move the plan ten days forward. [36]  Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers a book, a tea set, and a tin of marbles. On 6 July, the Frank family left a note for the Kupers, asking them to take care of their cat Moortje. As the Associated Press reports: \"'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her. 'Could you keep them for me for a little while?'\" [37]On the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942, [38]  the Frank family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the  Prinsengracht , where some of Otto Frank's most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the  Achterhuis  (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, Otto, Edith and Anne walked several kilometres from their home. Margot cycled to the Prinsengracht with Miep Gies. [39] [40]  The door to the  Achterhuis  was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered. [41]Victor Kugler ,  Johannes Kleiman ,  Miep Gies , and  Bep Voskuijl  were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies' husband  Jan Gies  and Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the \"helpers\" for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Frank wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews. [42]On 13 July 1942, the Franks were joined by the Van Pels family, made up of Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by  Fritz Pfeffer , a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she found him to be insufferable and resented his intrusion, [43]  and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed. [44]  Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement. [45]  Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, \"the young typist\u2026 the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.\" [46]In her writing, Frank examined her relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She was closest emotionally to her father, who later said, \"I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did.\" [47]  The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, \"Margot's much nicer\u2026 She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count.\" [48]Frank frequently wrote of her difficult relationship with her mother, and of her ambivalence towards her. On 7 November 1942, she described her \"contempt\" for her mother and her inability to \"confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness,\" before concluding, \"She's not a mother to me.\" [49]  Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: \"Anne, is it really you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?\" [50]  She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect. [51]The Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as they were able, and continued with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a course 'Elementary Latin'  by correspondence  in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. [52]  Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature. [53]Frank aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944:I finally realized that I must do my schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know I can write ..., but it remains to be seen whether I really have talent ...And if I don't have the talent to write books or newspaper articles, I can always write for myself. But I want to achieve more than that. I can't imagine living like Mother, Mrs. van Daan and all the women who go about their work and are then forgotten. I need to have something besides a husband and children to devote myself to! ...I want to be useful or bring enjoyment to all people, even those I've never met. I want to go on living even after my death! And that's why I'm so grateful to God for having given me this gift, which I can use to develop myself and to express all that's inside me!When I write I can shake off all my cares. My sorrow disappears, my spirits are revived! But, and that's a big question, will I ever be able to write something great, will I ever become a journalist or a writer? [54]She continued writing regularly until her last entry of 1 August 1944. [55]On the morning of 4 August 1944, the  Achterhuis  was stormed by a group of German uniformed police ( Gr\u00fcne Polizei ) led by  SS - Oberscharf\u00fchrer   Karl Silberbauer  of the  Sicherheitsdienst . [56]  The Franks, Van Pelses, and Pfeffer were taken to  RSHA  headquarters, where they were interrogated and held overnight. On 5 August, they were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the  Weteringschans  [ nl ] . Two days later they were transported to the  Westerbork transit camp , through which more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for  hard labour . [57]Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at  Amersfoort , in the province of Utrecht. Kleiman was released after seven weeks, but Kugler was held in various Dutch concentration and prison camps until the war's end. [58]   Miep Gies  was questioned and threatened by the Security Police but not detained.  Bep Voskuijl  managed to escape with a few documents that would have incriminated their black market contacts. During the following days, the two female secretaries returned to the  Achterhuis  and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. They collected them, as well as several family photograph albums, and Gies resolved to return them to Anne after the war. On 7 August 1944, Gies attempted to facilitate the release of the prisoners by confronting Silberbauer and offering him money to intervene, but he refused. [59]In 2015,  Flemish  journalist Jeroen De Bruyn and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl's youngest son, wrote a biography [a]  in which they alleged that Bep's younger sister (their aunt) Nelly (1923\u20132001) could have betrayed the Franks. Nelly was a Nazi collaborator from the age of 19 to 23. [60]  She had run away to Austria with a Nazi officer, and returned to Amsterdam in 1943 after the relationship ended. [61]  Nelly had been critical of Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl, for helping the Jews; [62]  Johannes was the one who constructed the bookcase covering the entrance to the hiding place and remained as an unofficial watchman of the hideout. [61]  In one of their quarrels, Nelly shouted to them, \"Go to your Jews.\" [63]   Karl Josef Silberbauer , the  SS  officer who made the arrest, was reported to have said that the informer had \"the voice of a young woman\". [64] [65] [ unreliable source? ]In 2016, the  Anne Frank House  published new research pointing to an investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a possible explanation for the raid that led to the arrest of the Franks. [66]  The report stated that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Otto Frank's company; however, it did not rule out betrayal. [67]A 2018 book suggested  Ans van Dijk , a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo, as a potential candidate for the informant. Dutch resistance fighter Gerard Kremer, who worked as a caretaker at an office building requisitioned by the  Sicherheitsdienst , apparently witnessed Van Dijk visiting the building in August 1944 and overheard her talking with her SD superiors about Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding. However, another book examining this possibility noted that many of Van Dijk's victims had lived in or near Prinsengracht. [68]In January 2022, some investigators [ who? ]  proposed  Arnold van den Bergh , a member of Amsterdam's  Jewish Council  who died in 1950, as the suspected informant. [69] [70]  The investigators postulated that Van den Bergh gave up the Franks to save his family. The investigation is chronicled in  Rosemary Sullivan 's English-language book,  The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation . [71]  Evidence was also claimed to have been found that Anne Frank's father later knew this but did not reveal it after the war. [69]  According to the  BBC , these investigators \"spent six years using modern investigative techniques to crack the 'cold case\u2026'.\" [69]  However, according to  The New York Times , several World War II and Holocaust scholars have doubted the methods and conclusions of the investigators, calling the evidence \"far too thin\". [72]Shortly after the publication of  The Betrayal of Anne Frank , after criticism from scholars Bart van der Boom, David Barnouw and Johannes Houwink ten Cate, Dutch publishing house Ambo Anthos, which had published a Dutch translation, apologized via an internal email. The publisher said they should have been more critical and announced that they are \"await(ing) the answers from the researchers to the questions that have emerged and are delaying the decision to print another run\". [73] [74] [75]  In response, Pieter van Twisk, one of the investigators referenced in the book, said that he was \"perplexed by the email\" and that the investigators had never claimed to have uncovered the complete truth. [75]  In March 2022, a group of World War Two experts and historians published their analysis of the conclusions and of the historical sources used in  The Betrayal of Anne Frank ; they contested the central claim that the Amsterdam Jewish council even had a list of Jewish hiding places that Van den Bergh could draw on, and concluded that the accusation of Van den Bergh was based on weak assumptions and lack of historical knowledge. [76]  As a result, the Dutch language version of the book was recalled by Ambo Anthos. [77] [78]On 19 August 2022, the Dutch researcher Natasha Gerson published an 80-page report analyzing the annotations and sources in  The Betrayal of Anne Frank , which argued that the theory in the book was not only flawed but the product of source fraud. [79] [80] [81]  The report concluded that Otto Frank's recorded agenda, as well as a letter Otto received from helper  Johannes Kleiman  and several other statements, were proven to be distorted to suit the outcome in the book. Several negative claims about Van den Bergh had Anton Schepers, a Nazi collaborator who was diagnosed twice as insane and who had taken over Van den Bergh's notary practice, as the only source. This included the claim of Nazi contacts and a commission of 200,000  guilders  paid on the sale of  Jacques Goudstikker 's art business. While  The Betrayal of Anne Frank  stated that Van den Bergh enjoyed the protection of two high-up Nazis, the CCT [ clarification needed ]  and Sullivan had omitted statements that the named Nazis had not known Van den Bergh. [82]  Plans to publish a German translation of Sullivan's book, previously postponed, were cancelled soon afterwards. [80]On 3 September 1944, [b]  the group was deported on what would be the last transport from Westerbork to the  Auschwitz concentration camp  and arrived after a three-day journey; on the same train was  Bloeme Evers-Emden , an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the  Jewish Lyceum  [ nl ]  in 1941. [83]  Bloeme saw Anne, Margot, and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, [84]  and was interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the television documentary  The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank  (1988) by Dutch filmmaker  Willy Lindwer [85]  and the BBC documentary  Anne Frank Remembered  (1995). [86]Upon arrival at Auschwitz, the  SS  forcibly split the men from the women and children, and Otto Frank was separated from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the  gas chambers . Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the  Achterhuis  had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated. [87]With the other women and girls not selected for immediate death, Frank was forced to strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was  tattooed with an identifying number  on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread  rations  for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by  scabies . The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall. [88]In October 1944, the Frank women were scheduled to join a transport to the Liebau  labour camp  in  Lower Silesia . Bloeme Evers-Emden was scheduled to be on this transport, but Anne was prohibited from going because she had developed scabies, and her mother and sister opted to stay with her. Bloeme went on without them. [86]On 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to  Bergen-Belsen . More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died of disease, starvation, and exhaustion. [89] [90]  Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly.Anne Frank was briefly reunited with two friends,  Hanneli Goslar  and  Nanette Blitz , who were also confined in the camp. Blitz had been moved from the Sternlager to the same section of the camp as Frank on 5 December 1944, [91]  while Goslar had been held in the Sternlager since February 1944. [92]  Both women survived the war, and later discussed the conversations they had with Frank, Blitz in person [93]  and Goslar through a barbed wire fence. [94]  Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering, [93]  remarking: \"[The] shock of seeing her in this emaciated state was indescribable.\" Anne told her that she hoped to write a book based on the diary when the war ended. [95]  Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. [96]  She also recalled she did not see Margot, as she was too weak to leave her bunk, [97]  while Blitz stated she met with both of the Frank sisters. [98]  Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that reason she did not wish to live any longer. [98] [97]  Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945. [96]Anne Frank died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in February or March 1945. The specific cause is unknown; however, there is evidence to suggest that she died from a  typhus  epidemic that spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners. [99]   Gena Turgel , a survivor of Bergen-Belsen, knew Anne at the camp. In 2015, she told the British newspaper  The Sun : \"Her bed was around the corner from me. She was delirious, terrible, burning up.\" She said she had brought Frank water to wash. [100]  Turgel, who worked in the camp hospital, said that the epidemic took a terrible toll on the inmates: \"The people were dying like flies\u2014in the hundreds. Reports used to come in\u2014500 people who died. Three hundred? We said, 'Thank God, only 300.'\" [100]  Other diseases, including  typhoid fever , were rampant. [101]Witnesses later testified Margot fell from her bunk in her weakened state and was killed by the shock. Anne died a day after Margot. [102] [103]  The dates of Margot's and Anne's deaths were not recorded. It was long thought that their deaths occurred only a few weeks before  British troops  liberated the camp on 15 April 1945, [104]  but research in 2015 indicated that they may have died as early as February. [105]  Among other evidence, witnesses recalled that the Franks displayed typhus symptoms by 7 February, [1] [106] [107] [108]  and Dutch health authorities reported that most untreated typhus victims died within 12 days of their first symptoms. [105]  Additionally, Hanneli Goslar stated her father,  Hans Goslar  [ de ] , died one or two weeks after their first meeting; [109] [ better source needed ]  Hans died on 25 February 1945. [110]  After the war, it was estimated that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived. An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the  Dutch underground . Approximately two thirds of this group survived the war. [111]Otto Frank survived his internment in Auschwitz. After the war ended, he returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned of the death of his wife, Edith, during his journey to Amsterdam, [112]  but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered.  Sanne Ledermann , often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister,  Barbara Ledermann , a close friend of Margot's, had survived. [113]  Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [114]In July 1945, after the sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Anne and Margot Frank in Bergen-Belsen, [115]  confirmed the deaths of the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank Anne's notebooks (including the red-and-white checkered diary) and a bundle of loose notes that she and  Bep Voskuijl  had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw for the first time the more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For me it was a revelation\u2026 I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings\u2026 She had kept all these feelings to herself\". [116]  Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published. [117]Frank's diary began as a private expression of her thoughts; she wrote several times that she would never allow anyone to read it. She candidly described her life, her family and companions, and their situation, while beginning to recognize her ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, she heard a radio broadcast by  Gerrit Bolkestein \u2014a member of the Dutch  government in exile , based in  London \u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation. [118]  He mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Frank decided to submit her work when the time came. She began editing her writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. Her original notebook was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. She created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The Van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, she addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in  Cissy van Marxveldt 's  Joop ter Heul  novels that Anne enjoyed reading. Otto Frank used her original diary, known as \"version A\", and her edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although he restored the true identities of his own family, he retained all of the other pseudonyms. [119]Otto Frank gave the diary to the historian  Annie Romein-Verschoor , who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. She then gave it to her husband  Jan Romein , who wrote an article about it, titled  \"Kinderstem\"  (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper  Het Parool  on 3 April 1946. He wrote that the diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at  Nuremberg  put together.\" [120]  His article attracted attention from publishers, and the diary was published in the Netherlands as  Het Achterhuis  ( The Annex ) (literally, \"the back house\") in 1947, [121]  followed by five more printings by 1950. [122]It was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title  Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl , was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war. [123]A play by  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett  based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a  Pulitzer Prize for Drama . It was followed by the film  The Diary of Anne Frank  (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer  Melissa M\u00fcller  later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne's story.\" [124]  Over the years the popularity of the diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United States, it was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers. [125]The diary has been praised for its literary merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist  Meyer Levin  commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\", [126]  and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication. [127]  Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography  The Obsession . The poet  John Berryman  called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\". [128]In her introduction to the diary's first American edition,  Eleanor Roosevelt  described it as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read.\" [129]   John F. Kennedy  discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, \"Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.\" [130] [131]  In the same year, the Soviet writer  Ilya Ehrenburg  wrote of her: \"one voice speaks for six million\u2014the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl.\" [132]As Anne Frank's stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, she has been discussed specifically as a symbol of  the Holocaust  and more broadly as a representative of persecution. [133]   Hillary Clinton , in her acceptance speech for an  Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award  in 1994, read from Anne Frank's diary and spoke of her \"awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll it takes on our young,\" which Clinton related to contemporary events in  Sarajevo ,  Somalia  and  Rwanda . [134]  After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994,  Nelson Mandela  addressed a crowd in  Johannesburg , saying he had read Anne Frank's diary while in prison and \"derived much encouragement from it.\" He likened her struggle against Nazism to his struggle against  apartheid , drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: \"Because these beliefs are patently false, and because they were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, they are bound to fail.\" [135]  Also in 1994,  V\u00e1clav Havel  said \"Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and it can address us fully\" in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries. [130]Primo Levi  suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because \"One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\" [130]  In her closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne symbolizes the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives\u2026 But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.\" [136]Otto Frank spent the remainder of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed.\" He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, \"he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally\". [137]  Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the  Nuremberg Trials , because \"people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this.\" [138]In June 1999,  Time  magazine published a special edition titled \" Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century \". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, \"The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, \"The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\" [139]After the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and/or its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway. [140]  In 1957,  Fria ord  (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish  neofascist  organization  National League of Sweden , published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author  Georg Brandes . [141]  Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin. [142]In 1958, at a performance of  The Diary of Anne Frank  in Vienna,  Simon Wiesenthal  was challenged by a group of protesters who asserted that Anne Frank had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for  Karl Silberbauer  and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank. [143]In 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in  L\u00fcbeck  against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former  Hitler Youth  member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Stielau, which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined the diary in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. They declared the diary to be genuine. Stielau recanted his earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further. [142]In 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Roth were to publish any further statements he would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Roth appealed against the court's decision. He died in 1978, and after a year his appeal was rejected. [142]Otto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed the same pamphlet in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. R\u00f6mer was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks, [142]  and Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired. [144]With Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, [145]  which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. They examined the handwriting against known examples and found that they matched. They determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time the diary was said to have been written. They concluded that the diary is authentic, and their findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary. [146]  In 1990, the Hamburg Regional Court confirmed the diary's authenticity. [147]In 1991,  Holocaust deniers   Robert Faurisson  and  Siegfried Verbeke  produced a booklet titled \" The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach \", in which they revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the  Achterhuis  would have been impossible. [148]  In 1993, the  Anne Frank House  in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of the diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement. [149]Since the original publication, several sections of Anne's diaries which were initially edited out have been revealed and included in new editions. [150]  These contain passages relating to her sexuality, exploration of her genitalia, and her thoughts on menstruation. [151] [152]  Following the conclusion of an ownership dispute in 2001, new editions have also incorporated pages removed by Otto Frank prior to publication which contain critical remarks about her parents' strained marriage and discuss her difficult relationship with her mother. [153] [154]  Two additional pages which Anne had pasted over with brown paper were deciphered in 2018, and contained an attempt to explain sex education and a handful of \"dirty\" jokes. [152] [155]On 3 May 1957, a group of Dutch citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting in an effort to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the  Achterhuis , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the  Allied Forces , all now protected behind  acrylic glass . The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbors, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. [156]  One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received an average of 1.2 million visitors between 2011 and 2020. [157]In 1963, Otto Frank and his second wife,  Elfriede Geiringer-Markovits , set up the Anne Frank Fonds as a  charitable foundation , based in  Basel , Switzerland. Upon his death, Otto willed the diary's copyright to the Fonds, on the provision that the first 80,000  Swiss francs  in income each year was to be distributed to his heirs. The Anne Frank Fonds represents the Frank family and administers the rights,  inter alia , to the writings of Anne and Otto Frank and to the letters of the Frank family. It is the owner of the rights to translations, editions, compilations, and authorised books about Anne Frank and her family. The Fonds educate young people against racism, and loaned some of Anne Frank's papers to the  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  in Washington for an exhibition in 2003. Its annual report that year outlined its efforts to contribute on a global level, with support for projects in Germany, Israel, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. [158]In 1997, the  Anne Frank Educational Centre  ( Jugendbegegnungsst\u00e4tte Anne Frank ) was opened in the  Dornbusch  neighbourhood of Frankfurt, where Frank lived with her family until 1934. The centre is \"a place where both young people and adults can learn about the history of National Socialism and discuss its relevance to today.\" [159]The Merwedeplein apartment, where the Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, remained privately owned until the 2000s. After featuring in a television documentary, the building\u2014in a serious state of disrepair\u2014was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard \"Buddy\" Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely in their own country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour. [156]Anne Frank is included as one of the topics in the  Canon of the Netherlands , which was prepared by a committee headed by  Frits van Oostrom  and presented to the Minister of Education, Culture and Science,  Maria van der Hoeven , in 2006. The Canon is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. A revised version, which still includes her as one of the topics, was presented to the Dutch government on 3 October 2007, [160]  and approved in 2020. [161]In June 2007, \"Buddy\" Elias donated some 25,000 family documents to the Anne Frank House. Among the artefacts are Frank family photographs taken in Germany and the Netherlands and the letter Otto Frank sent his mother in 1945, informing her that his wife and daughters had perished in Nazi concentration camps. [162]In November 2007, the  Anne Frank tree \u2014by then infected with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk\u2014was scheduled to be cut down to prevent it from falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist  Arnold Heertje  said about the tree: \"This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews.\" [163]  The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the  horse chestnut , which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. [164]  The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. [163]  However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. [165]  Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at  The Children's Museum of Indianapolis . Saplings were also sent to a school in  Little Rock, Arkansas , the scene of a desegregation battle;  Liberty Park (Manhattan) , which honours victims of the  September 11 attacks ; and other sites in the United States. [166]  Another horse chestnut tree honouring Frank was planted in 2010 at  Kelly Ingram Park  in  Birmingham, Alabama . [167]Over the years, several  films about Anne Frank  appeared. Her life and writings have inspired a diverse group of artists and social commentators to make  reference to her  in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include  The Anne Frank Ballet  by  Adam Darius , [168]  first performed in 1959, and the choral works  Annelies  (2005) [169]  and  The Beauty That Still Remains  by  Marcus Paus  (2015). [170]  The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbor. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the Anne Frank House. [171]In 1999,  Time  named Anne Frank among the heroes and icons of the 20th century on their list  The Most Important People of the Century , stating: \"With a diary kept in a secret attic, she braved the Nazis and lent a searing voice to the fight for human dignity\". [139]   Philip Roth  called her the \"lost little daughter\" of  Franz Kafka . [172]   Madame Tussauds  wax museum unveiled an exhibit featuring a likeness of Anne Frank in 2012. [173]  Asteroid  5535 Annefrank  was named in her honour in 1995, after having been discovered in 1942. [174]As of 2018, there are over 270 schools named after Anne Frank worldwide. 100 of them are in  Germany , 89 in  France , 45 in  Italy , 17 in the  Netherlands  (among them the  6th Montessori School  in Amsterdam which Frank herself attended until 1941), 4 in  Brazil , 4 in the  United States  (among them the  Anne Frank Inspire Academy ), 2 in  Bulgaria  and one each in  Argentina ,  Belgium ,  Canada ,  Colombia ,  El Salvador ,  Spain ,  Hungary ,  Israel ,  Nepal ,  Uruguay  and  Sweden . [175]  In 2020, the first of a series of Anne Frank Children's Human Rights Memorials was placed adjacent to a high school in Maaleh, Adumim, outside of Jerusalem. [176]  In 2021, the second memorial was unveiled in Antigua, Guatemala, [177]  and another is in fabrication in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be opened on  International Holocaust Remembrance Day , 27 January 2022. [178]   In 2023, a plan to rename a  daycare  centre in  Tangerh\u00fctte , Germany, named for Anne Frank since 1970, was met with international outcry and eventually dropped. [179] [180]On 25 June 2022, a slideshow  Google Doodle  was dedicated in the honour of Anne Frank marking the 75th anniversary of the publication of her diary.

        "response": " ## Anne Frank: A Life Cut Short\n\nAnne Frank was a young Jewish girl whose life and writing have become symbols of hope and resilience in the face of oppression. Born Annelies Marie Frank on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany, Anne grew up in a liberal Jewish family with her parents, Otto and Edith, and her older sister, Margot. As the Nazis rose to power, the family fled to Amsterdam in 1933, where Anne spent most of her childhood.\n\nAnne was an inquisitive and imaginative child, who loved reading and writing. She received a diary as a birthday gift in 1942 and began documenting her life, never imagining the impact her words would have on future generations. Her diary, now known as \"The Diary of a Young Girl,\" offers a unique perspective on the everyday life of a young girl coming of age during one of history's darkest periods.\n\nAs the Nazi threat loomed, Anne and her family went into hiding in July 1942, taking refuge in a concealed annex above her father's office building. They were joined by another family, the Van Pels, and a dentist named Fritz Pfeffer. For two years, they lived in constant fear of discovery, relying on a small group of trusted friends for food and supplies. Anne's writing became a source of comfort and self-expression during this time, as she poured her thoughts, dreams, and observations into her diary.\n\nAnne's writing reveals a thoughtful and insightful young woman beyond her years. She wrote about her relationships with her family and fellow occupants of the annex, her aspirations to become a writer, and her thoughts on the world around her. Despite the horrors of the Holocaust, Anne's writing is marked by hope and resilience, reflecting her unwavering belief in the goodness of humanity. She wrote, \"I keep my ideals, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.\"\n\nIn August 1944, their hiding place was discovered, and Anne and her family were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Anne and her sister, Margot, were eventually transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February or March 1945, just months before the camp was liberated. Anne was only 15 years old.\n\nAfter the war, Otto Frank, the sole survivor of the family, returned to Amsterdam, where he was given Anne's diary, which had been saved by a family friend. He published her diary in 1947, hoping to fulfill his daughter's dream of becoming a writer. \"The Diary of a Young Girl\" has since been translated into over 70 languages and has become one of the most widely read books in the world.\n\nAnne Frank's life and writing continue to inspire people around the world. Her diary offers a powerful reminder of the human capacity for courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Her story serves as a testament to the importance of remembering the Holocaust and standing against prejudice and discrimination.

She married Charles in 1929, and in 1930 became the first woman to receive a U.S.  glider pilot  license.

Following the 1932  kidnapping and murder of their first-born infant child , Anne and Charles moved to Europe in 1935 to escape the American press and hysteria surrounding the case, where their views shifted during the preliminary time of  World War II  towards an alleged sympathy for  Nazi Germany  and a concern for the United States\u2019 ability to compete with Germany in the war with their opposing air power. When they returned to America in 1939, the couple supported the isolationist  America First Committee  before ultimately expressing public support for the U.S. war effort after the 1941  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  and subsequent  German declaration of war against the United States .After the war, she moved away from politics and wrote extensive poetry and nonfiction that helped the Lindberghs regain their reputation, which had been greatly damaged since the days leading up to the war. She authored the popular  Gift from the Sea  (1955), and became an inspirational figure for many American women.  According to  Publishers Weekly , the book was one of the top nonfiction bestsellers of the 1950s. [1]  After suffering a series of  strokes  throughout the 1990s that left her disoriented and disabled, Anne died in 2001 at the age of 94.Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in  Englewood, New Jersey . [2]  Her father was  Dwight Morrow , a partner in  J.P. Morgan & Co. , who became  United States Ambassador to Mexico  and  United States Senator  from New Jersey. Her mother,  Elizabeth Cutter Morrow , was a poet and teacher, active in women's education, [3]  who served as acting president of her alma mater  Smith College . [4]Anne was the second of four children; her siblings were Elisabeth Reeve, [5]  Dwight, Jr., and Constance. The children were raised in a Calvinist household that fostered achievement. [6]  Every night, Morrow's mother would read to her children for an hour. The children quickly learned to read and write, began reading to themselves, and writing poetry and diaries. Anne would later benefit from that routine, eventually publishing her later diaries to critical acclaim. [7]She first attended the  Dwight School for Girls  in Englewood. [8]  After graduating from  The Chapin School  in New York City in 1924, where she was president of the student body, she attended  Smith College  from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1928. [4] [9]She received the  Elizabeth Montagu  Prize, for her essay on women of the 18th century such as  Madame d'Houdetot , and the Mary Augusta Jordan Literary Prize, for her fictional piece \"Lida Was Beautiful\". [10]Morrow and Lindbergh met on December 21, 1927, in  Mexico City . [11]  Her father, Lindbergh's financial adviser at J. P. Morgan and Co., invited him to  Mexico  to advance good relations between it and the United States. [12]At the time, Morrow was a shy 21-year-old senior at Smith College. Lindbergh was a high-profile aviator whose solo flight across the Atlantic made him a hero of immense proportions. [9]  The sight of the boyish aviator, who was staying with the Morrows, tugged at Morrow's heartstrings. She would later write in her diary:He is taller than anyone else\u2014you see his head in a moving crowd and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer, and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire.... What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral. [11]They were married in a private ceremony on May 27, 1929, at the home of her parents in Englewood, New Jersey. [13] [4] [14]That year, Anne Lindbergh flew solo for the first time, and in 1930, she became the first American woman to earn a first-class  glider pilot's license . In the 1930s, Charles and Anne explored and charted air routes between continents together. [15]  The Lindberghs were the first to fly from Africa to South America and explored polar air routes from North America to Asia and Europe. [16]Their first child, Charles Jr., was born on Anne's 24th birthday, June 22, 1930. [17]On March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs' first child, 20-month-old  Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. , was kidnapped from their home,  Highfields , in  East Amwell, New Jersey , outside  Hopewell . [a]  Arriving at the Lindbergh home police began the first search into the disappearance of young Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., there police witnessed two clear sets of footprints outside of the Lindbergh home. One set specifically led southeast towards a ladder that was believed to be used in the abduction.  Upon the discovery of intruders, police returned inside the home to begin their initial search of the nursery.  Before calling the police Charles Lindbergh uncovered a plain white envelope located on the windowsill.  Believing it was a ransom note, Charles left it for police inspection. Expert in crime-scene photography and fingerprints, Corporal Frank Kelly, was a part of the group that was investigating the disappearance of Charles Augustus Lindbergh.  After processing the envelope for any evidence revealed a smudged fingerprint which would later be sent to the state official in charge, Major Schoeffel. Inside the envelope was a detailed ransom note from the kidnapper giving the Lindberghs guided instructions for the return of their child. [19]Dear Sir! Have 50.000$ redy 25 000$ in 20$ bills 15000$ in 10$ bills and 10000$ in 5$ bills After 2\u20134 days we will inform you were to deliver the mony. We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Police the child is in gut care. Indication for all letters are Singnature and 3 hohls. [20]After a massive investigation, a baby's body presumed to be that of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was discovered on May 12, 1932, some 4 miles (6.5 km) from the Lindbergh home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell\u2013Mt. Rose highway. [21]The press paid frenzied attention to the Lindberghs after the kidnapping of their son and the trial, conviction, and execution of  Richard Hauptmann  for the crime. This\u2014and threats and press harassment of their second son Jon\u2014prompted the family to retreat to the United Kingdom, to a house called  Long Barn  owned by  Harold Nicolson  and  Vita Sackville-West , and later to the small island of  Illiec , off the coast of  Brittany  in France. [22]While in Europe during the 1930s, the Lindberghs came to advocate  isolationist views  and an opposition to American involvement in the impending European conflict, which led to their fall from grace in the eyes of many and widespread suspicion that the couple might be Nazi sympathizers. There exists evidence to support that Anne was an admirer of Hitler and shared many of her husband's anti-immigrant and antisemitic views. Anne Morrow's work was part of the  literature event  in the  art competition  at the  1936 Summer Olympics  in Berlin. [23]In April 1939, the Lindberghs returned to the United States. Because of his outspoken beliefs about a future war that would envelop their homeland, the antiwar  America First Committee  quickly adopted Charles as its leader in 1940. [12]In 1940, Anne published a 41-page booklet,  The Wave of the Future: A Confession of Faith , which \"swiftly became the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller in the country.\" [24]  Writing in support of her husband's lobbying efforts for a U.S.-German peace treaty similar to  Hitler's   Non-Aggression Treaty  with  Joseph Stalin , [25]  Anne argued that the rise of  fascism  and  communism  in Germany, Italy, and Russia were manifestations of an inevitable historical \"wave of the future\", [26]  though \"the evils we deplore in these systems are not in themselves the future; they are scum on the wave of the future.\" [27]  She compared these movements to the  French Revolution  for their deplorable violence, but also for their \"fundamental necessity\". She therefore urged the futility of any ideological war against them. [27]  Her writing echoed authors such as  Lawrence Dennis  and presaged that of  James Burnham . [28]The Roosevelt administration subsequently attacked  The Wave of the Future  as, in an April 1941 speech by  Interior Secretary   Harold Ickes , \"the bible of every American Nazi, Fascist,  Bundist  and Appeaser,\" and the booklet became one of the most despised writings of the period. [29] [30] [31]  She had also written in a letter that  Hitler  was \"a very great man, like an inspired religious leader\u2014and as such rather fanatical\u2014but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power\". [30]After the  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor  and  Germany's declaration of war against the U.S. , the America First Committee disbanded, and Charles eventually managed to become involved in the military and enter combat only as a civilian consultant, flying 50 missions in this role and even shooting down an enemy aircraft. [32] [33]In this period, Anne met the French writer, poet and pioneering aviator  Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry , author of the novella  The Little Prince . Though Anne found \"St-Ex\" attractive, the two did not have a secret affair, as is sometimes erroneously reported. [34]The Lindberghs had five more children: sons  Jon , Land, and Scott, and daughters  Anne  and  Reeve . [35] [36]After the war, she wrote books that helped the Lindberghs rebuild the reputations which they had lost before  World War II . The publication of  Gift from the Sea  in 1955 earned her place as \"one of the leading advocates of the nascent environmental movement\" and became a national bestseller. [37]Over the course of their 45-year marriage, the Lindberghs lived in  New Jersey , New York, the United Kingdom, France,  Maine ,  Michigan ,  Connecticut ,  Switzerland , and  Hawaii . Charles died on the island of  Maui  in 1974.According to one biographer, Anne had a three-year affair in the early 1950s with her personal doctor. [38]According to Rudolf Schr\u00f6ck, author of  Das Doppelleben des Charles A. Lindbergh  (\"The Double Life of Charles A. Lindbergh\"), Anne was unaware that Charles had led a double life from 1957 until his death in 1974. His affair with Munich hat maker Brigitte Hesshaimer produced three children whom he supported financially. After Hesshaimer's passing in 2003, DNA tests conducted by the  University of Munich  proved that her three children were fathered by Lindbergh. [39]  Schr\u00f6ck reported that Brigitte's sister Marietta also bore him two sons. Lindbergh had two more children with his former private secretary. A family reconciliation with the German family members later took place with Reeve Lindbergh being actively involved. [40]After suffering a series of  strokes  that left her confused and disabled in the early 1990s, Anne continued to live in her home in  Connecticut  with the assistance of round-the-clock caregivers. During a visit to her daughter Reeve's family in 1999, she came down with  pneumonia , after which she went to live near Reeve in a small home built on Reeve's  Passumpsic, Vermont , farm, where Anne died in 2001 at 94, following another stroke. [41]  Reeve Lindbergh's book,  No More Words , tells the story of her mother's last years. [42]Anne received numerous honors and awards throughout her life in recognition of her contributions to both literature and aviation. In 1933, she received the U.S. Flag Association Cross of Honor for having taken part in surveying transatlantic air routes. The following year, she was awarded the  Hubbard Medal  by the  National Geographic Society  for having completed 40,000 miles (64,000 km) of exploratory flying with her husband, Charles Lindbergh, a feat that took them to five continents. In 1993, Women in Aerospace presented her with an Aerospace Explorer Award in recognition of her achievements in and contributions to the aerospace field. [3] [13]She was inducted into the  National Aviation Hall of Fame  (1979), the  National Women's Hall of Fame  (1996), the  Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey , and the  International Women in Aviation Pioneer Hall of Fame  (1999). [3]Her first book,  North to the Orient  (1935) won one of the  inaugural National Book Awards : the Most Distinguished General Nonfiction of 1935, voted by the American Booksellers Association. [43] [44]Her second book,  Listen! The Wind  (1938), won the same award in its fourth year [45]  after the Nonfiction category had subsumed Biography. She received the  Christopher Award  for  War Within and Without , the last installment of her published diaries. [46]In addition to being the recipient of honorary master's and doctor of letters degrees from her alma mater  Smith College  (1935 and 1970), Anne received honorary degrees from  Amherst College  (1939), the  University of Rochester  (1939),  Middlebury College  (1976), and  Gustavus Adolphus College  (1985).

        "response": "\nHere is the biography:\n\nAnne Morrow Lindbergh was an American writer and aviator who led a remarkable life filled with adventure, tragedy, and controversy. Born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, New Jersey, Anne grew up in a privileged and intellectual environment. Her father, Dwight Morrow, was a partner in J.P. Morgan & Co., and her mother, Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, was a poet and teacher who valued education and encouraged her children's creativity.\n\nAnne's love for writing and literature was nurtured from a young age. She attended prestigious schools and graduated from Smith College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1928. It was around this time that she met Charles Lindbergh, a celebrated aviator who had recently completed a historic solo flight across the Atlantic. They married in 1929, and Anne soon became a pioneering aviator in her own right, earning her glider pilot's license and joining her husband on exploratory flights to chart air routes between continents.\n\nTogether, Charles and Anne Lindbergh embarked on a series of daring expeditions, becoming the first to fly from Africa to South America and exploring polar air routes. Their adventures, however, were marred by tragedy when their firstborn son, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. The highly publicized trial and execution of the kidnapper, Richard Hauptmann, led the Lindberghs to seek refuge in Europe, where they lived for several years.\n\nDuring their time in Europe, the Lindberghs' views shifted towards isolationism and an alleged sympathy for Nazi Germany, which later caused controversy back in the United States. Anne's writing during this period, including her booklet \"The Wave of the Future,\" reflected these changing political beliefs and was met with strong criticism. Despite the backlash, Anne continued to write and publish extensively.\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1939, Anne and Charles became involved in the America First Committee, advocating for American non-intervention in World War II. However, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany's subsequent declaration of war against the US, their views evolved, and they ultimately expressed support for the American war effort.\n\nIn the post-war years, Anne focused on writing and published several books, including \"Gift from the Sea,\" which became a national bestseller and established her as a leading voice in the environmental movement. She also received numerous honors and awards for her contributions to literature and aviation, including induction into multiple aviation halls of fame.\n\nAnne's personal life was not without its challenges. She suffered a series of strokes in the 1990s, which left her confused and disabled. She spent her final years in Vermont, near her daughter Reeve, and passed away peacefully in 2001 at the age of 94.\n\nRemembered for her courage, intellect, and literary talent, Anne Morrow Lindbergh's legacy continues to inspire and influence generations of women. Her writing, marked by a blend of personal reflection and philosophical insight, offers a unique perspective on the human condition and our relationship with the natural world.",

        "response": "<|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Sure, here is a biography of Anne Nicodemus Carpenter, with a focus on her life and poetic style: \n\nAnne Nicodemus Carpenter: A Life in Poetry \n\nAnne Nicodemus Carpenter, born in 1862 in Pennsylvania, was a poet with a unique style that blended traditional forms with a modern sensibility. Her poetry, often inspired by nature and her own experiences, reflects a deep love for the beauty in the world and a keen awareness of the emotions and struggles of everyday life. \n\nAs a young woman, Carpenter showed early promise as a writer. She was educated at the State Normal School in California, Pennsylvania, and began her career as a teacher, a profession she would return to throughout her life. However, her true passion lay in poetry, and she dedicated much of her free time to writing and refining her craft. \n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of Carpenter's poetry is her use of traditional forms and rhyme schemes. She favored structured verse, such as sonnets, villanelles, and rhyming couplets, often with a subtle twist or a surprise in the final lines. This traditionalism reflects her admiration for the great poets of the past, particularly the English romantics and the Victorian poets. In her own words, she described her style as \"a blending of the old and new\u2014a respect for tradition with a modern voice.\" \n\nA fine example of Carpenter's work is her poem, \"Grandson,\" which showcases her skillful use of rhyme and meter. The poem, written in iambic tetrameter, has a gentle, lilting rhythm that reflects the speaker's loving attitude toward the child: \n\n> \"Grandson, your eyes are very wise,\n> Though but a year you've been alive,\n> And in your gaze, to my surprise,\n> I see the spark of one alive.\"\n\nHere, Carpenter captures the sense of wonder and joy that a child can bring, and the way their innocence and wisdom can surprise and delight. \n\nCarpenter's poetry often explores universal themes of love, loss, nature, and family. She had a particular talent for capturing the beauty in everyday moments and the emotional depth of seemingly simple experiences. For example, her poem \"Ma's Ram\" (from which \"Grandson\" was extracted for individual publication) is a heartfelt tribute to her mother and the family home, filled with nostalgic imagery and a sense of warmth and comfort. \n\n> \"Ma's ram is a sturdy old fellow,\n> With a coat that is curly and brown,\n> And a pair of horns that would make you follow,\n> If you met him out in the town.\"\n\nIn contrast, her poem \"The Old Oak's Story\" takes on a more melancholy tone as it reflects on the passing of time and the endurance of nature in the face of human transience: \n\n> \"The old oak tree stands by the highway side,\n> A giant of the forest, gaunt and gray,\n> His branches spread like a great fan wide,\n> And 'neath his shade I love to wander aye.\"\n\nCarpenter's work was well-received during her lifetime, and she published several collections, including \"Ma's Ram and Other Poems,\" from which many of her most popular poems were taken. She was active in literary circles and was a member of various poetry societies and clubs, including the Saturday Press, which published some of her work. \n\nThroughout her life, Carpenter continued to teach and inspire others, both through her poetry and her dedication to education. She passed away in 1938, leaving behind a body of work that continues to enchant readers with its timeless themes and elegant style. \n\nIn conclusion, Anne Nicodemus Carpenter's poetry endures as a testament to her skill, passion, and unique voice. Her work invites readers to appreciate the beauty and emotion in the world around them, and to find comfort and joy in the art of poetry itself.",

Married to the painter Fairfield Porter, she raised five children in a busy, artistic household, frequently forced to pursue writing on the side.

        "reflected_response": "\nJohn Ashbery, one of the most renowned American poets of the 20th century, had a unique and enigmatic style that defied easy categorization. Known for his experimental approach to language and form, Ashbery's poetry often explored the nature of consciousness and the human experience. His work displayed a remarkable range, from surrealist collages to more traditional verse, often infused with wit and wordplay. Born in 1927 in Rochester, New York, Ashbery grew up in a rural setting that influenced his early writing. He attended Harvard University, where he studied under renowned critics like Harry Levin and began publishing his poetry in the university's literary magazine. After graduating, he traveled to France and became enamored with the country's art and culture, which would later influence his work greatly. While in Paris, he befriended many artists and writers, including the renowned French poet Pierre Martory, who would become a lifelong friend and source of inspiration. Upon returning to the United States, Ashbery continued to craft his distinctive style, publishing several collections that received critical acclaim. His 1975 collection, \"Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,\" won him the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award, bringing him widespread recognition. Ashbery's later works continued to push the boundaries of form and language, solidifying his legacy as a master of modern poetry. He passed away in 2017, leaving behind an enduring contribution to American literature. \n\nHere is a quote from Ashbery that showcases his thoughts on poetry: \n\n\"I think I write poetry because I don't really understand things, and I'm trying to understand them... Poetry is a way of learning and of finding things out.\" \n"

Supplement your biography with any relevant information from the following: Anne Sexton was born Anne Gray Harvey in Newton, Massachusetts, on November 9, 1928. She attended boarding school at Rogers Hall Lowell, Massachusetts, where she first started writing poetry. She attended Garland Junior College for one year and married Alfred Muller Sexton II at age nineteen. Sexton and her husband spent time in San Francisco before moving back to Massachusetts for the birth of their first daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, in 1953.After her second daughter was born in 1955, Sexton was encouraged by her doctor to pursue an interest in poetry that she had developed in high school. In the fall of 1957, she joined writing groups in Boston that introduced her to many writers such as Maxine Kumin, Robert Lowell, and Sylvia Plath. She published her first two books, To Bedlam and Part Way Back (1960) and All My Pretty Ones (1962), with Houghton Mifflin.In 1965, Sexton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in London. She then went on to win the 1967 Pulitzer Prize in poetry for her third collection,\u00a0Live or Die (Houghton Mifflin, 1966). In total, Sexton published nine volumes of poetry during her lifetime, including Love Poems (Houghton Mifflin, 1969), The Book of Folly (Houghton Mifflin, 1973) and The Awful Rowing Toward God (Houghton Mifflin, 9175). She also authored several children's books with Maxine Kumin.\nSexton received several major literary prizes including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1967 Shelley Memorial Prize, the 1962 Levinson Prize, and the Frost Fellowship to the Bread Loaf Writers Conference. She taught at Boston University and Colgate University, and died on October 4, 1974, in Weston, Massachusetts. Her papers are collected and housed at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\u00a0Deborah Digges's poems often rely on the relationship between humans and nature, the primitive urges of discovery and rediscovery, and the physical consequences of such momentary losses of the self.Edgar Bowers was born in 1924 in Rome, Georgia, where his father ran a plant nursery.Born April 5, 1904, in Austin, Minnesota, Richard Eberhart authored many collections of poetry and helped found the Poets' Theatre, Inc.On March 1, 1917, Robert Lowell was born into one of Boston\u2019s oldest and most prominent families.The author of several collections of poetry and the novel The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath is often singled out for the intense coupling of violent or disturbed imagery with the playful use of alliteration and rhyme in her work.David Ignatow was born in Brooklyn on February 7, 1914, and spent most of his life in the New York City area., Anne Gray Harvey [1928-1974] was born in Newton, Massachusetts. She\u00a0 married Alfred Muller Sexton II at age nineteen. She enrolled in a modeling course at the Hart Agency and lived in San Francisco and Baltimore. In 1953 she gave birth to a daughter. In 1954 she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, suffered her first mental breakdown, and was admitted to Westwood Lodge, a neuropsychiatric hospital she would repeatedly return to for help. In 1955, following the birth of her second daughter, Sexton suffered another breakdown and was hospitalized again; her children were sent to live with her husband's parents. That same year, on her birthday, she attempted suicide.Encouraged by her doctor she enrolled in 1957 in a poetry workshop at the Boston Center for Adult Education. There she became close friends with Maxine Kumin who was also enrolled there. \n\nWriting poetry gave Sexton soemthing to look forward to, the strenght to carry on a goal to work towards and helped her to go on for as long as she did.\n\nSexton offers the reader an intimate view of the emotional anguish that characterized her life. She made the experience of being a woman a central issue in her poetry, and though she endured criticism for bringing subjects such as menstruation, abortion, and drug addiction into her work, her skill as a poet transcended the controversy over her subject matter.\n\nShe won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967 for Live or Die\n\nIn 1974 at the age of 46, she lost her battle with mental illness and committed suicide.\n, Anne Sexton was born in Newton, Massachusetts and raised in Weston, Massachusetts. One of the most popular poets of mid-20th century America, Sexton&rsquo;s impressive body of work continues to be widely read and debated by literary scholars and cultural critics alike. According to Diane Hume George, &ldquo;Anne Sexton&rsquo;s poetry tells stories that are immensely significant to mid-twentieth-century artistic and psychic life. Sexton understood her culture&rsquo;s malaise through her own, and her skill enabled her to deploy metaphorical structures at once synthetic and analytic &hellip; Sexton explored the myths by and through which our culture lives and dies: the archetypal relationships among mothers and daughters, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, gods and humans, men and women. She perceived, and consistently patterned in the images of her art, the paradoxes deeply rooted in human behavior and motivation. Her poetry presents multiplicity and simplicity, duality and unity, the sacred and the profane, in ways that insist on their similarities&mdash;even, at times, their identity. In less abstract terms, Sexton made explicit the intimacy of forces persistently treated as opposites by the society she lived in.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a successful businessman, Sexton&rsquo;s childhood was materially comfortable but not happy. Her relationships with her parents were difficult, perhaps even abusive. Sexton&rsquo;s closest confidante was her maiden great-aunt. She attended boarding school and after graduation enrolled in Garland Junior College for one year. Sexton later described Garland as a &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; school. At age 19, she married Alfred &ldquo;Kayo&rdquo; Sexton II. While Kayo was serving in Korea, Anne became a fashion model. In 1953, she gave birth to her first child and in 1955, her second. Sexton suffered from post-partum depression, and after the birth of her first daughter she suffered her first breakdown and was admitted to a neuropsychiatric hospital. Other institutionalizations followed. Sexton struggled with depression for the remainder of her life. She committed suicide at age 46.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn treatment, her therapist encouraged her to write and in 1957 Sexton joined writing groups in Boston that eventually led her to friendships and relationships with the poets Maxine Kumin, Robert Lowell, George Starbuck, and Sylvia Plath. As Sexton told Beatrice Berg, her writing began, in fact, as therapy: &ldquo;My analyst told me to write between our sessions about what I was feeling and thinking and dreaming.&rdquo; Her analyst, impressed by her work, encouraged her to keep writing, and then, she told Berg, she saw (on television) &ldquo;I. A. Richards [a poet and literary critic] describing the form of a sonnet and I thought maybe I could do that. Oh, I was turned on. I wrote two or three a day for about a year.&rdquo; Eventually, Sexton&rsquo;s poems about her psychiatric struggles were gathered in her first book, To Bedlam and Part Way Back (1960), which recounts, as James Dickey wrote, the experiences &ldquo;of madness and near-madness, of the pathetic, well-meaning, necessarily tentative and perilous attempts at cure, and of the patient&rsquo;s slow coming back into the human associations and responsibilities which the old, previous self still demands.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSexton&rsquo;s work is usually grouped with other Confessional poets such as Plath, Lowell, John Berryman, and W. D. Snodgrass. In an interview with Patricia Marx, Sexton discussed Snodgrass&rsquo;s influence: &ldquo;If anything influenced me it was W. D. Snodgrass&rsquo; Heart&rsquo;s Needle. &hellip; It so changed me, and undoubtedly it must have influenced my poetry. At the same time everyone said, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t write this way. It&rsquo;s too personal; it&rsquo;s confessional; you can&rsquo;t write this, Anne,&rsquo; and everyone was discouraging me. But then I saw Snodgrass doing what I was doing, and it kind of gave me permission.&rdquo; Sexton&rsquo;s books after To Bedlam and Part Way Back included All my Pretty Ones (1962), Live or Die (1966), which won the Pulitzer Prize, Love Poems (1969), the play Mercy Street (1969). Transformations (1972), a series of retellings of Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales is often described as her least overtly &ldquo;confessional&rdquo; and most feminist work. Sexton&rsquo;s last published collection was The Death Notebooks (1974); posthumously published volumes included The Awful Rowing toward God (1975), 45 Mercy Street (1976), and Words for Dr. Y: Uncollected Poems with Three Stories (1978).\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSexton&rsquo;s work was enormously popular during her lifetime and she was the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Frost Fellowship to the Bread Loaf Writers&rsquo; Conference, the Radcliffe Institute Fellowship, the Levinson Prize, the American Academy of Arts and Letters traveling fellowship, the Shelley Memorial Prize, and an invitation to give the Morris Gray reading at Harvard. She also received a Guggenheim Fellowship, grants from the Ford Foundation, honorary degrees, and held professorships at Colgate University and Boston University. Despite her many achievements, critical discussions of her work tended to focus on the apparently autobiographical elements of her verse. Dickey&rsquo;s admonishment of Sexton&rsquo;s second book was somewhat typical: &ldquo;Miss Sexton&rsquo;s work seems to me very little more than a kind of terribly serious and determinedly outspoken soap-opera.&rdquo; Yet Sexton&rsquo;s canniness about the power of fiction, the uses of fact and imagination, and the poem&mdash;or poet&mdash;as essentially performance mean that no simple equations between poet and poem, life and art, can be drawn. In an early essay on both Bedlam and Pretty Ones, Beverly Fields argued that Sexton&rsquo;s poetry is mostly misread. She contended that the poems are not as autobiographical as they seem, that they are poems, not memoirs, and she went on to analyze many of them in depth in order to show the recurrent symbolic themes and poetic techniques that she felt make Sexton&rsquo;s work impressive. Recent scholars such as Gillian White have focused on Sexton&rsquo;s manipulation of voice and audience to suggest her work warrants more, or different, scrutiny than it has previously received. &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOne of Sexton&rsquo;s earliest champions, Erica Jong, reviewing The Death Notebooks assessed Sexton&rsquo;s poetic significance and contended that her artistry was seriously overlooked: &ldquo;She is an important poet not only because of her courage in dealing with previously forbidden subjects, but because she can make the language sing. Of what does [her] artistry consist? Not just of her skill in writing traditional poems &hellip; But by artistry, I mean something more subtle than the ability to write formal poems. I mean the artist&rsquo;s sense of where her inspiration lies &hellip;There are many poets of great talent who never take that talent anywhere &hellip; They write poems which any number of people might have written. When Anne Sexton is at the top of her form, she writes a poem which no one else could have written.&rdquo;, Anne Sexton  (born  Anne Gray Harvey ; November 9, 1928 \u2013 October 4, 1974) was an American poet known for her highly personal,  confessional verse . She won the  Pulitzer Prize  for poetry in 1967 for her book  Live or Die . Her poetry details her long battle with bipolar disorder, suicidal tendencies, and intimate details from her private life, including relationships with her husband and children, whom it was later alleged she physically and sexually assaulted.Anne Sexton was born Anne Gray Harvey in  Newton, Massachusetts  to Mary Gray (Staples) Harvey (1901\u20131959) and Ralph Churchill Harvey (1900\u20131959). She had two older sisters, Jane Elizabeth (Harvey) Jealous (1923\u20131983) and Blanche Dingley (Harvey) Taylor (1925\u20132011). She spent most of her childhood in Boston. In 1945 she enrolled at Rogers Hall boarding school in  Lowell, Massachusetts , later spending a year at  Garland School . [2]  For a time she  modeled  for Boston's Hart Agency. On August 16, 1948, she married Alfred Muller Sexton II and they remained together until 1973. [3] [4]  Sexton had her first child,  Linda Gray Sexton , in 1953. Her second child, Joyce Ladd Sexton, was born two years later.Sexton suffered from severe  bipolar disorder  for much of her life, her first manic episode taking place in 1954. After a second episode in 1955 she met  Dr. Martin Orne , who became her long-term therapist at the Glenside Hospital. It was Orne who encouraged her to write poetry. [5]The first poetry workshop she attended was led by  John Holmes . Sexton felt great trepidation about registering for the class, asking a friend to make the phone call and accompany her to the first session. She found early acclaim with her poems; a number were accepted by  The New Yorker ,  Harper's Magazine  and the  Saturday Review . Sexton later studied with  Robert Lowell  at  Boston University  alongside poets  Sylvia Plath  and  George Starbuck . [4] [6]Sexton later paid homage to her friendship with Plath in the 1963 poem \" Sylvia's Death \". Her first volume of poetry,  To Bedlam and Part Way Back , was published in 1960, and included the poem \" Her Kind \", which uses the persecution of witches as an analogy for the oppression of women in a patriarchal society. [7]Sexton's poetic career was encouraged by her mentor  W. D. Snodgrass , whom she met at the Antioch Writer's Conference in 1957. His poem \"Heart's Needle\" proved inspirational for her in its theme of separation from his three-year-old daughter. [8]  Sexton first read the poem at a time when her own young daughter was living with her mother-in-law. She, in turn, wrote \"The Double Image\", a poem which explores the multi-generational relationship between mother and daughter. Sexton began writing letters to Snodgrass and they became friends. [ citation needed ]While working with John Holmes, Sexton encountered  Maxine Kumin . They became good friends and remained so for the rest of Sexton's life. Kumin and Sexton rigorously critiqued each other's work and wrote four  children's books  together. In the late 1960s, the manic elements of Sexton's illness began to affect her career, though she still wrote and published work and gave readings of her poetry. She collaborated with musicians, forming a jazz-rock group called Her Kind that added music to her poetry. Her play  Mercy Street , starring  Marian Seldes , was produced in 1969 after several years of revisions. [9]  Sexton also collaborated with the artist  Barbara Swan , who illustrated several of her books. [10]Within 12 years of writing her first sonnet, she was among the most honored poets in the U.S.: a  Pulitzer Prize  winner, a fellow of the  Royal Society of Literature  and the first female member of the  Harvard  chapter of  Phi Beta Kappa . [11] [12]On October 4, 1974, Sexton had lunch with Kumin to revise galleys for Sexton's manuscript of  The Awful Rowing Toward God , scheduled for publication in March 1975 (Middlebrook 396). On returning home she put on her mother's old fur coat, removed all her rings, poured herself a glass of vodka, locked herself in her garage, and started the engine of her car, ending her life by  carbon monoxide poisoning . [13]In an interview over a year before her death, she explained she had written the first drafts of  The Awful Rowing Toward God  in 20 days with \"two days out for despair and three days out in a  mental hospital .\" She went on to say that she would not allow the poems to be published before her death. She is buried at  Forest Hills Cemetery & Crematory  in  Jamaica Plain ,  Boston ,  Massachusetts .Sexton is seen as the modern model of the  confessional poet  due to the intimate and emotional content of her poetry. Sexton often wrote and disclosed her struggles with mental illness through her work. Sexton included numerous topics which were then regarded as obscene and repulsive, especially for women to talk about publicly at the time. Maxine Kumin described Sexton's work: \"She wrote openly about menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, and drug addiction at a time when the proprieties embraced none of these as proper topics for poetry.\" [14]Sexton's work towards the end of the 1960s has been criticized as \"preening, lazy and flip\" by otherwise respectful critics. [11]  Some critics regard her dependence on alcohol as compromising her last work. However, other critics see Sexton as a poet whose writing matured over time. \"Starting as a relatively conventional writer, she learned to roughen up her line ... to use as an instrument against the 'politesse' of language, politics, religion [and] sex.\" [15]Her eighth collection of poetry is entitled  The Awful Rowing Toward God . The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, unwilling to administer  last rites , told her \"God is in your typewriter.\" This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing.  The Awful Rowing Toward God  and  The Death Notebooks  are among her final works, and both center on the theme of dying. [16]Her work started out as being about herself, however as her career progressed she made periodic attempts to reach outside the realm of her own life for poetic themes. [17]   Transformations  (1971), which is a re-visionary re-telling of  Grimm's Fairy Tales , is one such book. [18]( Transformations  was used as the  libretto  for the 1973  opera of the same name  by American composer  Conrad Susa .) Later she used  Christopher Smart 's  Jubilate Agno  and the  Bible  as the basis for some of her work. [19]Much has been made of the tangled threads of her writing, her life and her depression, much in the same way as with  Sylvia Plath 's suicide in 1963.  Robert Lowell ,  Adrienne Rich  and  Denise Levertov  commented in separate obituaries on the role of creativity in Sexton's death. Levertov says, \"We who are alive must make clear, as she could not, the distinction between creativity and self-destruction.\" [6]Following one of many suicide attempts and manic or depressive episodes, Sexton worked with therapist Martin Orne. [11]  He diagnosed her with what is now described as  bipolar disorder , but his competence to do so is called into question by his early use of allegedly unsound psychotherapeutic techniques. [20]  During sessions with Sexton, he used  hypnosis  and  sodium pentothal  to recover supposedly  repressed memories . During this process, he allegedly used suggestion to uncover memories of having been abused by her father. [21]  This abuse was disputed in interviews with her mother and other relatives. [22]Orne wrote that hypnosis in an adult frequently does not present accurate memories of childhood; instead, \"adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood.\" [23]  According to Orne, Sexton was extremely suggestible and would mimic the symptoms of the patients around her in the mental hospitals to which she was committed. Diane Middlebrook's biography states that a separate personality named Elizabeth emerged in Sexton while under hypnosis. Orne did not encourage this development and subsequently this \"alternate personality\" disappeared. Orne eventually concluded that Anne Sexton was suffering from  hysteria . [5]During the writing of the Middlebrook biography, her daughter,  Linda Gray Sexton , stated that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother. [21] [24]  In 1994, she published her autobiography  Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton , which includes her own accounts of the abuse. [25] [26]Middlebrook published her controversial biography of Anne Sexton with the approval of daughter Linda, Anne's literary executor. [5]  For use in the biography, Orne had given Diane Middlebrook most of the tapes recording the therapy sessions between Orne and Anne Sexton. The use of these tapes was met with, as  The New York Times  put it, \"thunderous condemnation\". [11]  Middlebrook received the tapes after she had written a substantial amount of the first draft of Sexton's biography, and decided to start over. Although Linda Gray Sexton collaborated with the Middlebrook biography, other members of the Sexton family were divided over the book, publishing several editorials and op-ed pieces in  The New York Times  and  The New York Times Book Review .Controversy continued with the posthumous public release of the tapes (which had been subject to  doctor-patient confidentiality ). They are said to reveal Sexton's molestation of her daughter Linda, [27] [26]  her physically violent behavior toward both her daughters, and her physical altercations with her husband. [24]Further controversy surrounds allegations that she had an \"affair with\" the therapist who replaced Orne in the 1960s. [28]No action was taken to censure or discipline the second therapist. Orne considered the \"affair\" with the second therapist (given the pseudonym \"Ollie Zweizung\" by Middlebrook and Linda Sexton) to be the catalyst that eventually resulted in her suicide. [6]Peter Gabriel  dedicated his song \" Mercy Street \" (named for her play  Mercy Street  and inspired by his reading of her poem \"45 Mercy Street\") from his 1986 album  So  to Sexton. [29]  She has been described as a \"personal touchstone\" for  Morrissey , former lead singer and lyricist of  The Smiths . [30]  She is commemorated on the  Boston Women's Heritage Trail . [31].",
        "response": "## Anne Sexton: A Life in Poetry\n\nAnne Sexton, born Anne Gray Harvey on November 9, 1928, in Newton, Massachusetts, was one of the most renowned and controversial poets of the 20th century. Her work, often categorized as confessional poetry, delved into the depths of her personal struggles with mental illness, her tumultuous relationships, and intimate details of her life that were considered taboo at the time. Through her raw and unapologetic verse, Sexton left an indelible mark on the literary world, offering a unique perspective on the human condition.\n\nSexton's introduction to poetry came during a difficult period in her life. After giving birth to her first daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, in 1953, she experienced postpartum depression and suffered her first mental breakdown. It was during her hospitalization that Sexton's doctor encouraged her to explore her creativity, and she began writing poetry. This therapeutic outlet soon became a passion, and in 1957, she joined writing groups in Boston, where she met fellow poets Maxine Kumin, Robert Lowell, and Sylvia Plath.\n\nSexton's early poems reflected her struggles with mental health and her time in psychiatric hospitals. Her first book, \"To Bedlam and Part Way Back\" (1960), chronicled her journey through madness and the slow process of recovery. Despite the personal nature of her work, Sexton's skill as a poet shone through, and she received critical acclaim. Her second book, \"All My Pretty Ones\" (1962), further established her as a talented poet with a unique voice.\n\nIn 1966, Sexton published her third collection, \"Live or Die,\" which cemented her place in the literary world. This collection earned her the prestigious Pulitzer Prize in Poetry in 1967. Sexton's poetry was raw, emotional, and often dark, exploring themes of suicide, abortion, drug addiction, and the complexities of human relationships. She did not shy away from controversial subjects, and her work sparked debates and challenged societal norms.\n\nAs Sexton's career progressed, her writing evolved. She began to experiment with different styles and themes, moving beyond the confines of her personal life. Her collection \"Transformations\" (1971) is a notable example, as it is a re-telling of Grimm's Fairy Tales, showcasing her creative versatility. During this period, Sexton also collaborated with other artists, forming a jazz-rock group called \"Her Kind\" that set her poetry to music, and working with artist Barbara Swan, who illustrated several of her books.\n\nDespite her success and recognition, Sexton continued to battle mental health issues. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and struggled with alcoholism. In 1974, at the age of 46, she lost her long battle with mental illness and took her own life. Her final collection, \"The Awful Rowing Toward God,\" was published posthumously in 1975 and provided a poignant insight into her state of mind during her final days.\n\nSexton's legacy is complex and often debated. While some critics admired her raw honesty and emotional depth, others found her work too personal and sensationalized. However, her impact on poetry is undeniable. She pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in literature, challenging societal taboos and giving voice to experiences that were often silenced.\n\nToday, Anne Sexton is remembered as a bold and innovative poet who fearlessly explored the depths of the human psyche. Her work continues to inspire and influence new generations of writers, serving as a testament to the power of art as a form of self-expression and a means of confronting our darkest demons. Through her poetry, Sexton has left an enduring mark on the literary world, offering a window into her soul and a glimpse into the universal struggles that unite us all.",
