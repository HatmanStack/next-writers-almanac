Her other poetry collections include All-Night Lingo Tango (2009), Babel (2004), Delirium (1995), and Lester Higata\u2019s 20th Century (2010), a short story collection that won the Iowa Short Fiction Prize/John Simmons Award.\n\nHamby\u2019s poetry has been featured in numerous anthologies, such as The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry (2011), three editions of Best American Poetry (2010, 2009, and 2000), and Good Poems for Hard Times (2006). Her work has also been recognized with several awards, including the Association of Writers & Writing Programs\u2019 Donald Hall Prize, the Vassar Miller Prize, the Kate Tufts Discovery Award, and the Poetry Society of America\u2019s Norma Farber First Book Award.\n\nHamby\u2019s poetry is characterized by its mix of high and pop cultural references, which she weaves together with formal strictness and lyrical extravagance. In an interview with BOMBLOG, Hamby explained that she finds formal constraints pleasing because they force her to dig deep into language and herself. This is evident in her use of long-lined odes, which give her extroverted and digressive imagination free play.\n\nA reviewer for Publishers Weekly described Hamby\u2019s fourth collection, All-Night Lingo Tango, as \u201cchatty and whimsical, literary and (at its best) laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d Hamby\u2019s interest in formal constraints is evident in her use of anaphora, the abecedarian corset, and sound repetition, which she uses to create a sense of musicality and depth in her poems.\n\nHamby has won several fellowships, including those from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as several grants from the Florida Arts Council. In 2010, she was named a Distinguished University Scholar at Florida State University, where she lives with her husband, fellow poet David Kirby, and works as a writer-in-residence in the Creative Writing Program.\n\nIn addition to her work as a poet, Hamby has also coedited an anthology, Seriously Funny (2010), with her husband. The anthology features a diverse range of poems that showcase the couple\u2019s shared interest in exploring the intersection of humor and poetry.\n\nThroughout her career, Barbara Hamby has established herself as a unique and important voice in American poetry. Her work continues to inspire and delight readers with its blend of high and pop cultural references, formal strictness, and lyrical extravagance. With her ability to create a sense of musicality and depth in her poems, Hamby remains a celebrated figure in the literary world.\n\nI made a few minor changes to the response to improve clarity and sentence structure. I also corrected a few spelling errors and logic problems. Here is the revised response:\n\nBarbara Hamby is a celebrated American poet known for her unique blend of high and pop cultural references, formal strictness, and lyrical extravagance.

They wrote things like Poem: \"Early Supper\" by Barbara Howes, from Light and Dark. \u00c2\u00a9 Wesleyan University Press, 1956. Reprinted with permission.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: Barbara Howes grew up in a suburb of Boston. Educated at Bennington College in Vermont, she moved to New York City after graduation. While submitting her poetry to magazines, Howes got a job editing Chimera: A Literary Magazine from 1944 to 1947. Although the job kept her from her own writing for several years, it would prove to be valuable, not only because it put her in contact with numerous other writers living in the city, but also because of the editorial skills Howes developed. These skills would be put to good use several years later when she edited several acclaimed short story anthologies: From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean (1966), The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories from Latin America (1973), and The Sea-Green Horse (1970) a young-adult short story anthology Howes compiled with her son, Gregory Jay Smith.\r\n\r\nDespite being nominated for the 1995 National Book Award for her The Collected Poems of Barbara Howes, 1945-1990, the work of poet Barbara Howes has received relatively little publicity; Robert Richman, writing in the New York Times, called Howes &ldquo;as obscure a worthy poet as I can think of.&rdquo; Usually alternating her backdrop between the gentle climate of the West Indies and the harsher landscape of her native New England, Howes&rsquo;s verses paint a world of family, natural surroundings, and the wisdom inherent in natural inclinations. &ldquo;I might say that my poems are about relationships,&rdquo; she wrote by way of explanation in an essay published in Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series (CAAS)&mdash;&ldquo;the relation of the poet&rsquo;s eye, mind, and heart to reality.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHowes&rsquo;s first collection of verse, The Undersea Farmer, was published in 1948. While recognizing that hers was a young talent, reviewers were quick to see the book as the work of an accomplished poet. 1954&rsquo;s In the Cold Country further refined Howes&rsquo;s considerable abilities, drawing even more critical acclaim. Praising her as &ldquo;the most accomplished women poet of the younger writing generation,&rdquo; Louise Bogan commented in New Yorker on Howes&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong, positive emotions that continually resolve into a major key.&rdquo; &ldquo;We sense the possibility of a new reconciliation in modern verse,&rdquo; concluded Bogan, &ldquo;for so long filled with division and dissent.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nComparing Howes&rsquo; verse to that of poet Wallace Stevens, Thom Gunn noted in Yale Review that &ldquo;at her best ... the very indirection of her style contributes to her meaning. Her most considerable power is in her control over language.&rdquo; This control was exhibited throughout Howes&rsquo; work, in volumes that include Light and Dark (1959), Looking Up at Leaves (1966), and The Blue Garden (1972), which Robert B. Shaw termed remarkable &ldquo;for the clarity of its descriptive passages&rdquo; in a review in Poetry. Her best work was anthologized in Collected Poems in 1990.\r\n\r\nAlthough she was acknowledged for her skill as a stylist, Howes was always quick to explain that her abilities are not the obvious outlet of &ldquo;God-given&rdquo; talent. &ldquo;One does not own one&rsquo;s talent ... and should not identify with it,&rdquo; she explained in her essay for CAAS; &ldquo;rather, one works at it, is responsible for tending this blithe or gloomy spirit which can flash in and fade out in its own inexplicable way. ... [T]alent, and the artist who houses and labors over it, are not one.&rdquo; Although recognizing that the possession of talent is necessary to any poetic endeavor, Howes added that &ldquo;the other base from which any art springs is simply real, steady work. If one sits around waiting for the lightning of inspiration to strike, it will surely descend over the way, where another poet is hard at it.&rdquo;, Barbara Howes  (May 1, 1914  New York City  \u2013 February 24, 1996  Bennington, Vermont ) was an American  poet .She was adopted and raised in  Chestnut Hill , attending Beaver Country Day School. She graduated from  Bennington College  in 1937.  She edited the literary magazine  Chimera  from 1943 to 1947 [1]  and lived in  Greenwich Village . In 1947 she married the poet  William Jay Smith  and had two sons, David and Gregory. After divorcing in \"the mid-1960s\", she lived in  Pownal, Vermont . [2]In 1971, she signed a letter protesting proposed cuts to the School of the Arts,  Columbia University . [3]Her work was published in,  Atlantic ,  Chicago Review ,  New Directions ,  New Republic ,  New Yorker , [4]   New York Times Book Review ,  Saturday Review ,  Southern Review ,  University of Kansas Review ,  Virginia Quarterly Review , and  Yale Review .Reading the  Collected Poems , one sees Howes very clearly as a woman writing in one of the oddest but most important traditions of American poetry. Howes stands with  Marianne Moore ,  Elizabeth Bishop , and ultimately  Emily Dickinson  in a lineage of women writers passionately committed to the independence and singularity of the poetic imagination. (To this group one might also add  Louise Bogan ,  Julia Randall ,  May Swenson , and  Josephine Miles ). They form an eccentric but eminent sorority.

A  Democrat , she was the first African American elected to the  Texas Senate  after  Reconstruction , the first  Southern  African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives, [2]  and one of the first two African Americans elected to the U.S. House from the former Confederacy since 1901, alongside  Andrew Young  of Georgia.Jordan achieved notoriety for delivering a powerful opening statement [3]  at the House Judiciary Committee hearings during the  impeachment process against Richard Nixon . In 1976, she became the first African-American, and the first woman, to deliver a keynote address at a  Democratic National Convention . She received the  Presidential Medal of Freedom , among numerous other honors.  She was the first African-American woman to be buried in the  Texas State Cemetery . [4] [5]  Jordan is also known for her work as chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.Barbara Charline Jordan was born in  Houston , Texas's  Fifth Ward . [2]  Jordan's childhood was centered  on church life. Her mother was Arlyne Patten Jordan, a teacher in the church, [1] [6]  and her father was Benjamin Jordan, a  Baptist  preacher. Through her mother, Jordan was the great-granddaughter of  Edward Patton , who was one of the last African American members of the  Texas House of Representatives  prior to disenfranchisement of Black Texans under  Jim Crow . Barbara Jordan was the youngest of three children, [1]  with siblings Rose Mary Jordan McGowan and Bennie Creswell Jordan (1933\u20132000). Jordan attended Roberson Elementary School. [6]  She graduated from  Phillis Wheatley High School  in 1952 with honors. [1] [6] [7]Jordan credited a speech she heard in her high school years by  Edith S. Sampson  with inspiring her to become an attorney. [8]   Because of segregation, she could not attend  The University of Texas at Austin  and instead chose  Texas Southern University , a  historically black institution , majoring in  political science  and history. At Texas Southern University, Jordan was a national champion  debater , defeating opponents from Yale and Brown, and tying Harvard University. [6]  She graduated  magna cum laude  in 1956. [6] [7]  At Texas Southern University, she pledged Delta Gamma chapter of  Delta Sigma Theta  sorority. [6]  She attended  Boston University School of Law , graduating in 1959. [6] [7]Jordan taught political science at  Tuskegee Institute  in  Alabama  for a year. [6]  In 1960, she returned to Houston and started a private law practice. [6]Jordan campaigned unsuccessfully in 1962 and 1964 for the  Texas House of Representatives . [9]  She won a seat in the  Texas Senate  in 1966, becoming the first African-American state senator in Texas since 1883 and the first black woman to serve in that body. [9]  Re-elected to a full term in the Texas Senate in 1968, she served until 1972. She was the first African-American woman to serve as president  pro tempore  of the state senate and served one day, June 10, 1972, as  acting governor of Texas . [10] [11]  Jordan was the first African-American woman to serve as governor of a state. [12]  During her time in the Texas Legislature, Jordan sponsored or cosponsored some 70 bills. [13]In 1972, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, the first woman elected in her own right to represent Texas in the House. She received extensive support from former  President   Lyndon B. Johnson , who helped her secure a position on the  House Judiciary Committee . In 1974, she made an influential televised speech before the House Judiciary Committee supporting the  impeachment  of President  Richard Nixon , Johnson's successor as president. [14]  In 1975, she was appointed by  Carl Albert , then  Speaker of the United States House of Representatives , to the  Democratic Steering and Policy Committee .In 1976, Jordan, mentioned as a possible running mate to  Jimmy Carter  of  Georgia , [9]  became instead the first African-American woman to deliver a keynote address at the  Democratic National Convention . [9]  Despite not being a candidate, Jordan received one delegate vote (0.03%) for president at the  Convention . [15]In November 1977, Barbara Jordan spoke at the  1977 National Women's Conference .  Other speakers included  Rosalynn Carter ,  Betty Ford ,  Lady Bird Johnson ,  Bella Abzug , Audrey Colom, Claire Randall, Gerridee Wheeler,  Cecilia Burciaga ,  Gloria Steinem ,  Lenore Hershey  and  Jean O'Leary . [16]On July 25, 1974, Jordan delivered a 15-minute televised speech in front of the members of the  U.S. House Judiciary Committee . [17]   She presented an opening speech during the hearings that were part of the  impeachment process against Richard Nixon . [17]  The speech was later rated among the 100 most significant American political speeches of the 20th century, based on a survey of 137 leading scholars of American public address, as compiled by Stephen E. Lucas and Martin J. Medhurst for AmericanRhetoric.com [18]  Throughout her speech, Jordan strongly stood by the  Constitution of the United States . She defended the  checks and balances  system, which was set in place to inhibit any politician from abusing their power. [17]  Jordan never directly said that she wanted Nixon impeached, but rather subtly and cleverly implied her thoughts. [19]  She simply stated facts that proved Nixon to be untrustworthy and heavily involved in illegal situations, [19]  and quoted the drafters of the Constitution to argue that actions like Nixon's during the scandal corresponded with their understanding of impeachable offenses. [20]  She protested that the  Watergate scandal  will forever ruin the trust American citizens have for their government. [19]  This powerful and influential statement earned Jordan national praise for her rhetoric, morals, and wisdom. [17]Jordan supported the  Community Reinvestment Act  of 1977, legislation that required banks to lend and make services available to underserved poor and minority communities. She supported the renewal of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  and expansion of that act to cover language minorities; this extended protection to Hispanics in Texas and was opposed by Texas Governor  Dolph Briscoe  and Secretary of State  Mark White . She also authored an act that ended federal authorization of price fixing by manufacturers. Jordan was also a proponent of the  Equal Rights Amendment  and issued a statement in support of extending the deadline in 1979. [21]  During Jordan's tenure as a Congresswoman, she sponsored or cosponsored over 300 bills or resolutions, several of which are still in effect today as law. [13]From 1994 until her death, Jordan chaired the  U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform . The commission recommended that total immigration be cut by one-third to approximately 550,000 per year. The commission supported increasing enforcement against undocumented migrants and their employers, eliminating visa preferences for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens, and ending unskilled immigration except for refugees and nuclear families. The commission's report to Congress said that it was \"a right and responsibility of a democratic society to manage immigration so that it serves the national interest\", concluded that \"legal immigration has strengthened and can continue to strengthen this country\" and \"decrie[d] hostility and discrimination against immigrants as antithetical to the traditions and interests of the country.\" The commission recommended that the United States reduce the number of refugees admitted annually to a floor of 50,000 (this level would be lifted during emergencies). [22] [23] [24] [25]The recommendations made by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform under Jordan's leadership are frequently cited by American immigration restrictionists. [26] [27]Jordan retired from politics in 1979 and became an adjunct professor teaching ethics at the  University of Texas at Austin   Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs . She was again a keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 1992.In 1994, Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the  NAACP  presented her with the Spingarn Medal. [1]  She was honored many times and was given over 20 honorary degrees from institutions across the country, including Harvard and Princeton, and was elected to the Texas and National Women's Halls of Fame. [1]The  U.S. National Archives  described Barbara Jordan as the first  LGBTQ + woman in Congress. [28]  Jordan's partner of approximately twenty years was Nancy Earl, [29]  an educational psychologist who met Jordan on a camping trip in the late 1960s. [7] [9]  Earl was an occasional speechwriter for Jordan, [30]  and later cared for her when she developed  multiple sclerosis  in 1973. [31]  While the  Houston Chronicle  obituary of Jordan identified Earl as her \"longtime companion\", [32]  and while other sources have stated that Earl was Jordan's same-sex partner, [32] [33] [31] [7] [9]  neither woman is known to have publicly stated that the two had a romantic relationship. [33] [34] [9]On July 31, 1988, Jordan nearly drowned in her backyard swimming pool while doing physical therapy, but she was saved by Earl, who found her floating in the pool and revived her. [35]In the  KUT-FM  radio documentary  Rediscovering Barbara Jordan ,  President   Bill Clinton  said that he had wanted to nominate Jordan for the  United States Supreme Court , but by the time he could do so, Jordan's health problems prevented him from nominating her. [36]Jordan died at the age of 59 of complications from  pneumonia  on January 17, 1996, in  Austin, Texas . She \nalso had  leukemia . [37]She was interred in  Texas State Cemetery . [38]  She was the first African American to receive this honor, and previously advocated African Americans to be buried in the state cemetery when she served in the Texas State Senate. [39]  Jordan's grave rests near that of the \"Father of Texas\"  Stephen F. Austin . [39]Jordan's 1974 statement on the articles of impeachment (regarding President  Richard Nixon ) was listed as #13 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). [42] [43]Jordan's 1976 Democratic National Convention keynote address, the first major convention keynote speech ever by a woman and the first by an African American, was listed as #5 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

Public Domain.\u00c2\u00a0(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: The poet, essayist, and playwright Ben Jonson was born on June 11, 1572 in London, England. His father, a minister, died shortly before his birth and his mother remarried a bricklayer.Jonson was raised in Westminster and attended St. Martin\u2019s parish school and Westminster School, where he came under the influence of the classical scholar William Camden. He left the Westminster school in 1589, worked briefly in his stepfather\u2019s trade as a bricklayer, then served in the military at Flanders, before working as an actor and playwright for Philip Henslowe\u2019s theater company.In 1594, Jonson married Anne Lewis and began to work as an actor and playwright. Jonson and Lewis had at least two children, but little else is known of their marriage.In 1598, Jonson wrote what is considered his first great play, Every Man in His Humor. In a 1616 production, William Shakespeare acted in one of the lead roles. Shortly after the play opened, Jonson killed Gabriel Spencer in a duel and was tried for murder. He was released by pleading \u201cbenefit of clergy\u201d (i.e., by proving he could read and write in Latin, he was allowed to face a more lenient court). He spent only a few weeks in prison, but shortly after his release he was again arrested for failing to pay an actor.Under King James I, Jonson received royal favor and patronage. Over the next fifteen years many of his most famous satirical plays, including Volpone (1606) and The Alchemist (1610), were produced for the London stage. In 1616, he was granted a substantial pension of one hundred marks a year, and is often identified as England\u2019s first poet laureate.Jonson\u2019s circle of admirers and friends, who called themselves the \u201cTribe of Ben,\u201d met regularly at the Mermaid Tavern and later at the Devil\u2019s Head. Among his followers were nobles such as the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, as well as writers, including Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Sir John Suckling, James Howell, and Thomas Carew. Most of his well-known poems include tributes to friends, notably\u00a0Shakespeare, John Donne, and Francis Bacon.Ben Jonson died in Westminster on August 8, 1637. A tremendous crowd of mourners attended his burial at Westminster Abbey. He is regarded as one of the major dramatists and poets of the seventeenth century., Ben Johnson [1572-1637]\u00a0 was a noted British poet, playwright and critic who is best remembered for some of his plays such as 'Volpone' and 'The Alchemist'. A contemporary of Shakespeare and, at the time, almost as popular.Born in London of Border descent, Jonson was the son of a clergyman who died before his son's birth. He was educated at Westminster School and then, embarking upon a life that would be characterised throughout by great diversity and outlandish events, worked for a time as a bricklayer for his stepfather. This was followed by military service in Flanders, some acting in a strolling company of actors, and marriage, in 1594, to Anne Lewis, prior to being imprisoned in 1597 for his involvement, as playwright and player, in a satire entitled The Isle of Dogs. \n\r\nOne year later he killed another actor in a duel but escaped execution by pleading benefit of clergy. During his subsequent imprisonment he converted to Roman Catholicism only to convert back to Anglicism over a decade later in 1701.\n\n\n\r\nIn the same year his most important play, the comedy Every Man in His Humour, was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The cast included Shakespeare. His first court masque, of which he produced several in the following years, was produced in 1605 - the same year in which he was, once again, imprisoned for his part in a satire, this time entitled Edward Hoe , and also gave evidence concerning the infamous Gunpowder Plot. The period of his major plays followed with the publication and production of Volpone (1605-6), Epicene (1609) and Bartholomew's Fair (1614), by which time he had also worked as a personal tutor in France and had travelled to Scotland where he recorded his famous conversations with Drummond of Hawthornden. \n\n\n\r\nIn 1616 he published his complete Works - poems, plays and masques. Roundabout the same time he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University and began to lecture on rhetoric at Gresham College, London. Two disasters followed: a fire, in 1623, that destroyed many of his belongings , and a stroke in 1628 from which he never fully recovered.\n\n\n\r\nJonson was a massive man - he spoke of his \"mountain belly\" - and a massively prolific writer. As well as his many plays and non-dramatic verses, his numerous masques include The Masque of Queens (1609), Love Restored (1612), Mercury Vindicated From the Alchemists at Court (1616), Pleasure Recounted to Virtue (1618)and Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (1624). His friends - Shakespeare, Donne, Francis Bacon, George Chapman and so on - were, and those he influenced remain even today, numerous. His tombstone in Westminster Abbey bears the apposite inscription \"O rare Ben Jonson\".\n\n\n\r\nPosthumously, in a second Jonson folio (1640), appeared Timber: or, Discoveries, a series of observations on life and letters. Here Jonson held forth on the nature of poetry and drama and paid his final tribute to Shakespeare: in spite of acknowledging a belief that his great contemporary was, on occasion, \"full of wind\"--sufflaminandus erat--he declared that \"I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.\", Ben Jonson is among the best-known writers and theorists of English Renaissance literature, second in reputation only to Shakespeare. A prolific dramatist and a man of letters highly learned in the classics, he profoundly influenced the Augustan age through his emphasis on the precepts of Horace, Aristotle, and other classical Greek and Latin thinkers. While he is now remembered primarily for his satirical comedies, he also distinguished himself as a poet, preeminent writer of masques, erudite defender of his work, and the originator of English literary criticism. Jonson&rsquo;s pro&shy;fessional reputation is often obscured by that of the man himself: bold, independent and aggressive. He fashioned for himself an image as the sole arbiter of taste, standing for erudition and the supremacy of clas&shy;sical models against what he perceived as the general populace&rsquo;s ignorant preference for the sensational. While his direct influence can be seen in each genre he undertook, his ultimate legacy is considered to be his literary craftsmanship, his strong sense of artistic form and control, and his role in bringing, as Alex&shy;ander Pope noted, &ldquo;critical learning into vogue.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJonson was born in London shortly after the death of his father, a minister who claimed descent from the Scottish gentry. Despite a poor upbringing, he was educated at Westminster School under the renowned antiquary William Camden. He apparently left his schooling unwillingly to work with his stepfather as a bricklayer. He then served as a volunteer in the Low Countries in the Dutch war against Spain, and the sto&shy;ry is told that he defeated a challenger in single com&shy;bat between the opposing armies, stripping his van&shy;quished opponent of his arms in the classical fashion. Returning to England by 1592, Jonson married Anne Lewis in 1594. Although the union was unhappy, it produced several children, all of whom Jonson out&shy;lived. In the years following his marriage, he became an actor and also wrote numerous &ldquo;get-penny&rdquo; enter&shy;tainments&mdash;financially motivated and quickly com&shy;posed plays. He also provided respected emendations and additions to Thomas Kyd&rsquo;s The Spanish Tragedy (1592). By 1597 he was writing for Philip Henslowe&rsquo;s theatrical company. That year, Henslowe employed Jonson to finish Thomas Nashe&rsquo;s satire The Isle of Dogs (now lost), but the play was suppressed for al&shy;leged seditious content and Jonson was jailed for a short time. In 1598 the earliest of his extant works, Every Man in His Humour, was produced by the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Men with William Shakespeare&mdash;who became close friends with Jonson&mdash;in the cast. That same year, Jonson fell into further trouble after killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel, narrowly escaping the gallows by claiming benefit of clergy (meaning he was shown leniency for proving that he was literate and educated). While incarcerated at Newgate prison, Jon&shy;son converted to Catholicism.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, writing for the Children of the Queen&rsquo;s Chapel, Jonson became embroiled in a public feud with playwrights John Marston and Thomas Dekker. In Cynthia&rsquo;s Revells and Poetaster (both 1601), Jonson portrayed himself as the impartial, well informed judge of art and society and wrote unflattering portraits of the two dramatists. Marston and Dekker counterat&shy;tacked with a satiric portrayal of Jonson in the play Satiromastix; or, The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet (1602). Interestingly, scholars speculate that the dis&shy;pute, which became known as the &ldquo;War of the The&shy;atres,&rdquo; was mutually contrived in order to further the authors&rsquo; careers. In any event, Jonson later reconciled with Marston, and collaborated with him and George Chapman in writing Eastward Ho! (1605). A joke at the King&rsquo;s expense in this play landed him once again, along with his coauthors, in prison. Once freed, how&shy;ever, Jonson entered a period of good fortune and productivity. He had many friends at court, and James I valued his learning highly. His abilities thus did not go unrecognized, and he was frequently called upon to write his popular, elegant masques, such as The Mas&shy;que of Blacknesse (1605). During this period, Jonson also produced his most successful comedies, begin&shy;ning in 1606 with Volpone and following with The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bar&shy;tholomew Fayre (1614). Jonson&rsquo;s remaining tragedies, Sejanus His Fall (1603) and Catiline His Conspiracy (1611), though monuments to his scholarship, were not well received due to their rigid imitation of classical tragic forms and their pedantic tone.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 Jonson published his Workes, becoming the first English writer to dignify his dramas by terming them &ldquo;works,&rdquo; and for this perceived presumption he was soundly ridiculed. In that year Jonson assumed the responsibilities and privileges of Poet Laureate, though without formal appointment. From 1616 to 1625 he primarily wrote masques for presentation at court. He had already collaborated with poet, architect, and stage designer Inigo Jones one several court masques, and the two continued their joint efforts, establishing the reign of James I as the period of the consummate masque. For his achievements, the University of Ox&shy;ford honored him in 1619 with a master of arts degree.\r\n\r\nMisfortune, however, marked Jonson&rsquo;s later years. A fire destroyed his library in 1623, and when James I died in 1625, Jonson lost much of his influence at court, though he was named City Chronologer in 1628. Later that year, he suffered the first of several strokes which left him bedridden. Jonson produced four plays during the reign of Charles I, and was eventually grant&shy;ed a new pension in 1634. None of these later plays was successful. The rest of his life, spent in retirement, he filled primarily with study and writing; at his death, on August 6, 1637, two unfinished plays were discov&shy;ered among his mass of papers and manuscripts. Jon&shy;son left a financially depleted estate, but was neverthe&shy;less buried with honor in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nJonson&rsquo;s earliest comedies, such as Every Man in His Humour, derive from Roman comedy in form and structure and are noteworthy as models of the comedy of &ldquo;humours,&rdquo; in which each character represents a type dominated by a particular obsession. Although Jonson was not the first to employ the comedy of humours, his use of the form in Every Man in His Humour and Every Man out of His Humour is considered exempla&shy;ry, and such characterization continued to be a feature of his work. Of particular significance in appraisals of Jonson are the four comical satires produced between 1606 and 1614: Volpone, The Silent Woman, The Al&shy;chemist, and Bartholomew Fayre. Each exposes some aberration of human appetite through comic exagger&shy;ation and periodic moralisms while evincing Jonson&rsquo;s interest in the variety of life and in the villain as a cunning, imaginative artist. Volpone, his most famous and most frequently staged work, is also his harshest attack on human vice, specifically targeting greed. Like The Silent Woman and The Alchemist, it mixes didac&shy;tic intent with scenes of tightly constructed comic coun&shy;terpoise. The last of Jonson&rsquo;s great dramas is the pan&shy;oramic Bartholomew Fayre. Softening the didacticism that characterized his earlier work, Jonson expressed the classical moralist&rsquo;s views of wisdom and folly through a multiplicity of layered, interrelated plots in a colorfully portrayed and loosely structured form. All four comedies exhibit careful planning executed with classical precision, a command of low speech and col&shy;loquial usage, and a movement toward more realistic, three-dimensional character depiction.\r\n\r\nCritics note that Jonson&rsquo;s later plays, beginning with The Divell is an Asse in 1616, betray the dramatist&rsquo;s diminishing artistry. These later dramas were dismissed by John Dryden, who undertook the first extensive anal&shy;ysis of Jonson, as mere &ldquo;dotages.&rdquo; While generously likening him to Virgil and calling him &ldquo;the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had,&rdquo; Dryden&rsquo;s comments also signaled the start of a decline in Jonson&rsquo;s reputation, for his observations included a comparison of Jonson and Shakespeare, one which nodded admiringly toward Jonson, but bowed adoring&shy;ly before Shakespeare. This telling comparison col&shy;ored Jonson&rsquo;s reputation for more than 200 years, fueled by such 19th-century Romantic critics as Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1818), and Will&shy;iam Hazlitt (1819), who found Jonson lacking in imag&shy;ination, delicacy, and soul. His &ldquo;greatest defect,&rdquo; ac&shy;cording to George Saintsbury, was the &ldquo;want of pas&shy;sion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;his merits are extraordi&shy;nary.&rdquo; Most 19th-century critics agreed with the assessment of John Addington Symonds that the &ldquo;higher gifts of poetry, with which Shakespeare&mdash;&lsquo;nature&rsquo;s child&rsquo;&mdash;was so richly endowed, are almost absolutely wanting in Ben Jonson.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nT.S. Eliot, writing in 1919, focused attention on Jonson&rsquo;s reputation as &ldquo;the most deadly kind that can be compelled upon the memory of a great poet. To be universally accepted; to be damned by the praise that quenches all desire to read the book; to be afflicted by the imputation of the virtues which excite the least pleasure; and to be read only by historians and anti&shy;quaries&mdash;this is the most perfect conspiracy of approv&shy;al.&rdquo; With this began a reevaluation of Jonson, whose reputation benefited from modernist reaction against Romanticist sensibility, and who began to be appreciated on his own terms. English critic L.C. Knights, in 1937, considered Jonson &ldquo;a very great poet&rdquo;; and while Edmund Wilson, in 1948, still found none of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;immense range&rdquo; in Jonson, he thought him &ldquo;a great man of letters&rdquo; and acknowl&shy;edged his influence on writers as diverse as Milton, Congreve, Swift, and Huxley. Recent scholarship has sought to place Jonson in the theatrical and political milieu of London, addressing his relationship with his audience and the monarchy. This focus on historical context has also produced an emphasis on the former bricklayer&rsquo;s &ldquo;self-fashioning&rdquo; into dramatist, critic, and finally the first poet laureate. Many critics now regard him as a fore-runner in the 17th-century move&shy;ment toward classicism, and his plays are often ad&shy;mired for their accurate depictions of the men and women of his day, their mastery of form, and their successful blend of the serious and the comic, the top&shy;ical, and the timeless., Benjamin Jonson  ( c. \u200911 June 1572  \u2013 c. \u20096 August 1637 ) [2]  was an English playwright and poet. Jonson's artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the  comedy of humours ; he is best known for the  satirical  plays  Every Man in His Humour  (1598),  Volpone, or The Fox  (c. 1606),  The Alchemist  (1610) and  Bartholomew Fair  (1614) and for his  lyric  and  epigrammatic  poetry. [3]  He is regarded as \"the second most important English dramatist, after  William Shakespeare , during the reign of  James I .\" [4]Jonson was a  classically educated , well-read and cultured man of the  English Renaissance  with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the  Jacobean era  (1603\u20131625) and of the  Caroline era  (1625\u20131642). [5] [6]In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who \"served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman\", [7]  was a member of the extended Johnston family of  Annandale  in the  Dumfries and Galloway , a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ( rhombi ) in the Jonson family  coat of arms : one spindle is a diamond-shaped  heraldic  device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter \"t\" (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common \"Johnson\", the playwright's own particular preference became \"Jonson\". [8]Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered  forfeiture  under  Queen Mary . Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. [7]  His widow married a master  bricklayer  two years later. [9] [10]  Jonson attended school in  St Martin's Lane  in London. [3]  Later, a family friend paid for his studies at  Westminster School , where the  antiquarian , historian,  topographer  and  officer of arms   William Camden  (1551\u20131623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and  literary style  remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet  Hugh Holland , with whom he established an \"enduring relationship\". [11]  Both of them would write preliminary poems for  William Shakespeare 's  First Folio  (1623).On leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson was to attend the  University of Cambridge , to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he could not. [5] [9]  According to the churchman and historian  Thomas Fuller  (1608\u201361), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in  Lincoln's Inn . After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the  Netherlands  and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir  Francis Vere  (1560\u20131609) in  Flanders . England was allied with the Dutch in their  fight for independence  as well as the  ongoing war with Spain .The  Hawthornden Manuscripts  (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet  William Drummond of Hawthornden [3]  (1585\u20131649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in  single combat , and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. [12]Johnson is reputed to have visited the antiquary  Sir Robert Cotton  at a residence of his in  Chester  early in the 17th century. [13]After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist \"Hieronimo\" (Geronimo) in the play  The Spanish Tragedy  (c. 1586), by  Thomas Kyd  (1558\u201394), the first  revenge tragedy  in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by  Philip Henslowe , the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of  Every Man in His Humour  (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist. [14] [15]Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of  St Magnus-the-Martyr , near  London Bridge . [16]The registers of  St Martin-in-the-Fields  record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of  bubonic plague  when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac \" On My First Sonne \" (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. [17]During that period [ clarification needed ] , Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons,   Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d'Aubigny  and Sir Robert Townshend. [16]By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the  Admiral's Men , then performing under  Philip Henslowe 's management at  The Rose . [3]   John Aubrey  reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer. [18]By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by  Francis Meres  in his  Palladis Tamia  as one of \"the best for tragedy.\" [3]  None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy,  The Case is Altered , may be his earliest surviving play. [19]In 1597, a play which he co-wrote with  Thomas Nashe ,  The Isle of Dogs , was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen  Elizabeth I 's so-called interrogator,  Richard Topcliffe . Jonson was jailed in  Marshalsea Prison  and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to  Great Yarmouth . Two of the actors,  Gabriel Spenser  and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in  Newgate Prison , for killing Gabriel Spenser in a  duel  on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields [12]  (today part of  Hoxton ). Tried on a charge of  manslaughter , Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by  benefit of clergy , [3]  a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the  neck-verse ), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb. [3]While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father  Thomas Wright , a  Jesuit  priest. [7]In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success,  Every Man in His Humour , capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which  George Chapman  had begun with  An Humorous Day's Mirth .  William Shakespeare  was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with  Every Man out of His Humour , a pedantic attempt to imitate  Aristophanes . [ non sequitur ]  It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions. [ citation needed ]Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy.  Cynthia's Revels  was produced by the  Children of the Chapel  Royal at  Blackfriars Theatre  in 1600. It satirised both  John Marston , who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in  Histriomastix , and  Thomas Dekker . Jonson attacked the two poets again in  Poetaster  (1601). Dekker responded with  Satiromastix , subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\". [3]  The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report \u2013 boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way. [ citation needed ]This \" War of the Theatres \" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming  James I  to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated  The Malcontent  to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on  Eastward Ho , a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail. [20]At the beginning of the English reign of  James VI and I  in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for  masques  and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort [3]   Anne of Denmark . In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as  Elizabeth Sidney  (daughter of  Sir Philip Sidney ) and  Lady Mary Wroth . This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the  country house poem   To  Penshurst .In February 1603  John Manningham  reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of  Sir Roger Townshend , and \"scorns the world.\" [21]  Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the  Privy Council  about  Sejanus , a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the  Gunpowder Plot  conspirators. After the plot's discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator  Robert Cecil  and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness. [7]At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court.  The Satyr  (1603) and  The Masque of Blackness  (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at  Apethorpe Palace  when the King was in residence.  The Masque of Blackness  was praised by  Algernon Charles Swinburne  as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.On many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer  Inigo Jones . For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque  Oberon, the Faery Prince  performed at  Whitehall  on 1 January 1611 in which  Prince Henry , eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100  marks  (about \u00a360), leading some to identify him as England's first  Poet Laureate . This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year. [3]  Other volumes followed in 1640\u201341 and 1692. (See:  Ben Jonson folios )On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the  Great North Road , and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. [22]  On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. [22]  He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet,  William Drummond of Hawthornden , [3]  sited on the  River Esk . Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\". [3]On returning to England, he was awarded an  honorary   Master of Arts   degree  from Oxford University.The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy  Catiline  (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success [3]  and the comedies  Volpone  (acted 1605 and printed in 1607),  Epicoene, or the Silent Woman  (1609),  The Alchemist  (1610),  Bartholomew Fair  (1614) and  The Devil Is an Ass  (1616). [3]   The Alchemist  and  Volpone  were immediately successful. Of  Epicoene , Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet  Epicoene , along with  Bartholomew Fair  and (to a lesser extent)  The Devil is an Ass  have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous  Protestant  landowner until the reign of \" Bloody Mary \" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On  Elizabeth 's accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman. [23] [24]  (All that is known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to  St Martin-in-the-Fields  parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at  Westminster School , then part of  Westminster Abbey .Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith. [25] [26]  This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in  Newgate Gaol  charged with  manslaughter . Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a  Jesuit  priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England. [27] [28]  Wright, although placed under  house arrest  on the orders of  Lord Burghley , was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. [27]  It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal  absolution  that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. [26]  Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the  Earl of Essex , was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. [29]  Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play  Sejanus His Fall  was banned for \" popery \", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. [7]  In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the  Consistory Court  in London to answer a charge of  recusancy , with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause. [30]  This was a serious matter (the  Gunpowder Plot  was still fresh in people's minds) but he explained that his failure to take  communion  was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen  shillings  (156  pence ) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time\u2014indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen  Anne of Denmark , herself\u2014to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. [31]  Leading church figures, including  John Overall ,  Dean of St Paul's , were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted. [32]In May 1610  Henry IV of France  was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England. [33] [34]  He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of  communion wine  at the  eucharist  to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. [35] [36]  The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. [34]  However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death. [37]Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the  Sons of Ben  or the \"Tribe of Ben\", those younger poets such as  Robert Herrick ,  Richard Lovelace , and  Sir John Suckling  who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of  Charles I 's England.  The Staple of News , for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of  The New Inn ; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience ( An Ode to Himself ), which in turn prompted  Thomas Carew , one of the \"Tribe of Ben\", to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline. [38]The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to \u00a3100 and included a  tierce  of wine and beer.Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play,  The Sad Shepherd . Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into  pastoral  drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with  James Howell , who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'. [21]  He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in  Westminster Abbey , with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson [ sic ]\" set in the slab over his grave. [3] [39]   John Aubrey , in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of  Great Milton ,  Oxfordshire , saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from  William Davenant , Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist  Leigh Hunt  contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used. [39] [40]  The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, [41]  although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space. [42] [43]It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of  Catholic doctrine  during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\". [7] [44] [45]A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's  Poets' Corner . [46]  It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the  English Civil War  intervened. [47]Apart from two tragedies,  Sejanus  and  Catiline , that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for  boy players , present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets' War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered.  Thomas Davies  called  Poetaster  \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of  Augustus Caesar ,  Maecenas ,  Virgil ,  Horace ,  Ovid  and  Tibullus , are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment\". Another early comedy in a different vein,  The Case is Altered , is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.The comedies of his middle career, from  Eastward Hoe  to  The Devil Is an Ass  are for the most part  city comedy , with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to  Volpone  to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \" dotages \", particularly  The Magnetic Lady  and  The Sad Shepherd , exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of  Elizabethan comedy .Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the  folio  version of  Every Man in His Humour : he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use\". He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory\u2014or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from  Plautus  and  Terence , he intended to apply those premises with rigour. [48]  This commitment entailed negations: after  The Case is Altered , Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of  new comedy . He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and  jealousy . In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the  farcical  (as  William Congreve , for example, judged  Epicoene ). He was more diligent in adhering to the  classical unities  than many of his peers\u2014although as  Margaret Cavendish  noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that  The Alchemist  had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the  humanist  manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as  Thomas Campion  and  Gabriel Harvey . Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.\"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson's epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \" On My First Sonne \" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the  sonnet  form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his  country-house poem  \"To Penshurst\" and the poem \" To Celia \" (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in  Volpone .Underwood , published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains  A Celebration of Charis , Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces;  encomiastic poems  including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on  Mary Wroth ; the  Execration against Vulcan  and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with  Shakespeare . William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in  Julius Caesar  and the setting of  The Winter's Tale  on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill). [49]In  \"De Shakespeare Nostrat\"  in  Timber , which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\" [a]  However, Jonson explains, \"Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent  Phantsie ; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp'd\". [51]  Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" When Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\" [52]Thomas Fuller  relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the  Mermaid Tavern ; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which ( Every Man in His Humour  and  Sejanus His Fall ) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated. [ citation needed ]Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's  First Folio . This poem,  \"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us\" , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\", [53]  had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form. [ citation needed ]Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'. [54]  Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies.  John Aubrey  wrote of Jonson in  Brief Lives . By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.In 2012, after more than two decades of research,  Cambridge University Press  published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years. [55]As G. E. Bentley notes in  Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared , Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the  Restoration  of  Charles II , Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and  Fletcher 's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among  English Renaissance dramatists . Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in  Timber , and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and  Samuel Butler  drew the same comparison in his  commonplace book  later in the century.At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma.  Charles de Saint-\u00c9vremond  placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and  Charles Gildon  called Jonson the father of English comedy.  John Dryden  offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his  Avatar  Neander compares Shakespeare to  Homer  and Jonson to  Virgil : the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" ( Discoveries,  33). For  Lewis Theobald , too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,\" in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius.  Nicholas Rowe , to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of  Every Man in his Humour  to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s,  Edward Young  casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier,  Aphra Behn , writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from  Sallust  and  Cicero ,  Augustan  critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his  aesthetic  judgment.In this period,  Alexander Pope  is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.\" [56]  For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s,  Sarah Fielding  could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple.Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described.  Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg  translated parts of  Peter Whalley 's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution,  Edward Capell  offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\" [57]  The disastrous failures of productions of  Volpone  and  Epicoene  in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as  Earl Camden  and  William Gifford , he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.The  romantic  revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: \"He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.\" Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as  Thomas Middleton  or  John Heywood , who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however;  William Gifford , Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era,  Swinburne , who was more interested in Jonson than most  Victorians , wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance\" \u2013 by \"fragrance,\" Swinburne means spontaneity.In the 20th century, Jonson's body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in  The Sacred Wood ,  T. S. Eliot  attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by  E. E. Stoll  and  M. C. Bradbrook , provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived  sociopolitical criticism . Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of  patronage  and in the rising culture of mass media.Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'. [58]  If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of  John Donne . In this comparison, Jonson represents the  cavalier  strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the  metaphysical  school of poetry, with its reliance on strained,  baroque  metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ( Herbert Grierson  for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian  Edmund Bolton  named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic;  Herrick  described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\". [3]  All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of  wit . In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English  neoclassicism .The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \" On My First Sonne \"; \" To Celia \"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the  epitaph  on Salomon Pavy, a  boy player  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.It is in Jonson's  Timber, or Discoveries...  that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man\u2019s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to  The Isle of Dogs  (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work:  Richard Crookback  (1602);  Hot Anger Soon Cold  (1598), with Porter and  Henry Chettle ;  Page of Plymouth  (1599), with Dekker; and  Robert II, King of Scots  (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant:  The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors  (1607);  The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I  (1608); and  The May Lord  (1613\u201319).Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in  Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother , a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy  The Widow  was printed in 1652 as the work of  Thomas Middleton , Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as  The London Prodigal , have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses. [61].",

At Marlborough he knew  John Betjeman  and  Louis MacNeice ; at  Oxford   Stephen Spender , and he also came across  W. H. Auden . He edited  Oxford Poetry  in 1930-1931. He was not, however, drawn far into what was soon known as the  Auden Group ; he is identified much more with the type of poetry later exemplified by  Lawrence Durrell , and is for some critics the stand-out in the  Cairo poets . His potential was never quite fulfilled, partly because of poor health [ clarification needed ] .After graduation, he made a living from teaching and writing, marrying the actress  Norah Gibbs  in 1936. At that time he was collaborating on  Geoffrey Grigson 's  New Verse . In  World War II  he worked for the  British Council , in  Greece  and then  Egypt . There he edited the  Personal Landscape  magazine.After the war he continued to work for the  British Council , being posted to  Italy . Norah died in 1947, of  tuberculosis . He himself was ill for a time. Through other postings he wrote little.He was married again in 1961, to  Anne Marjoribanks . He died in  Vienna , apparently in an accident [ clarification needed ] , while once more in bad health.A conference on Spencer's life and work was held at the  University of Reading  in October 2009, with an exhibition of manuscripts and other personal effects.

They wrote things like \"Tired As I Can Be\" a lyric by BessieJackson.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: Lucille Bogan  (born  Lucile Anderson ; April 1, 1897 \u2013 August 10, 1948) [1]  was an American  classic female blues  singer and songwriter, among the first to be recorded. She also recorded under the pseudonym  Bessie Jackson . Music critic  Ernest Borneman  noted that Bogan was one of \"the big three of the blues\", along with  Ma Rainey  and  Bessie Smith . [2]  Many of Bogan's songs have been recorded by later blues and jazz musicians. [3]Many of her songs were sexually explicit, and she is generally considered to have been a \" dirty blues \" musician. [2]In 2022, she was inducted into the  Blues Hall of Fame . [4]She was born Lucile  [ sic ] Anderson, the daughter of Gussie and Wylie Anderson. [5]   According to some sources, she was born in  Amory ,  Mississippi , [6]  but according to her entry in the  1900 census  her birthplace was  Birmingham ,  Alabama . [5] [2]  In 1914, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan, a railwayman, and gave birth to a son, Nazareth Jr., in either 1915 or 1916. She later divorced Bogan and married James Spencer.She first recorded  vaudeville  songs for  Okeh Records  in New York in 1923, with the pianist Henry Callens. [6]  Later that year she recorded \"Pawn Shop Blues\" in  Atlanta, Georgia ; this was the first time a black blues singer had been recorded outside New York or Chicago. [7]  In 1927 she began recording for  Paramount Records  in  Grafton ,  Wisconsin , where she recorded her first big success, \"Sweet Petunia\", which was covered by  Blind Blake . She also recorded for  Brunswick Records , backed by  Tampa Red .By 1930, her songs tended to concern drinking and sex, such as \"Sloppy Drunk Blues\" (written and first recorded by Bogan but released first by  Leroy Carr  in 1930 then by Bogan the following year, later recorded by others) and \"Tricks Ain't Walkin' No More\" (later recorded by  Memphis Minnie ). She also recorded the original version of \" Black Angel Blues \", which (as \"Sweet Little Angel\") was covered by  B. B. King  and many others. With her experience in some of the rowdier  juke joints  of the 1920s, many of Bogan's songs, most of which she wrote herself, have thinly veiled humorous sexual references. The theme of prostitution, in particular, featured prominently in several of her recordings. One of these was \"Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)\", which was originally written and recorded by  Charlie \"Specks\" McFadden . [8] [9]   Piggly Wiggly  is the name of a successful American  supermarket  chain, operating in the  South  and the  Midwest , which first opened in 1916. [10]  Bogan used the self-service notion in her amended lyrics to the song, part of which ran, \"My name is Piggly Wiggly and I swear you can help yourself, And you've got to have your greenback, and it don't take nothin' else\". [11]In 1933, she returned to New York, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for the  Banner  label of  ARC . She was usually accompanied on piano by  Walter Roland , with whom she recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes, \"Seaboard Blues\", \"Troubled Mind\", and \"Superstitious Blues\". [2]  Her other songs include \"Stew Meat Blues\", \"Coffee Grindin' Blues\", \" My Georgia Grind \" (when accompanied on piano by  Charles Avery ), \"Honeycomb Man\", \"Mr. Screw Worm in Trouble\", and \"Bo Hog Blues\".Her final recordings with Roland and  Josh White  include two takes of \" Shave 'Em Dry \", recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs. [7]  According to Keith Briggs' liner notes for  Document Records  Complete Recordings, these were recorded either for the fun of the recording engineers, or for \"clandestine distribution as a 'Party Record ' \". Briggs notes that Bogan seems to be unfamiliar with the lyrics, reading them as she sings them, potentially surprised by them herself. [12]  Another of her songs, \"B.D. Woman's Blues\", takes the position of a \" bull dyke \" (\"B.D.\"), with the lyrics \"Comin' a time, B.D. women, they ain't gonna need no men\", \"They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man\" and \"They can lay their jive just like a natural man.\" [6]She appears not to have recorded after 1935. She managed her son's jazz group, Bogan's Birmingham Busters, for a time, before moving to Los Angeles shortly before her death from  coronary sclerosis  in 1948. [1]  She is interred at the Lincoln Memorial Park, in  Carson, California .In 2022, she was posthumously inducted into the  Blues Hall of Fame . [4]  The citation noted that \"Bogan recorded some of the most memorable blues songs of the pre-World War II era, including some that were landmarks in blues and some that continue to sensationalize her reputation decades after her death\".

[7]  In 2022,  St. Martin's Press  published Glose's  All the Ruined Men , a collection of linked short stories about veterans facing difficulties at home after years of war.  The Millions  named  All the Ruined Men  one of the most anticipated books of the second half of 2022. [8]  and in 2023,  All the Ruined Men , won the Library of Virginia Award for Fiction. [9]Publishers Weekly: \u201cGlose writes knowingly about the emotions that assault soldiers coming home from a combat zone and confronting a world that no longer makes sense... This sterling collection stands with Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Things They Carried.\u201d [17]Kirkus Reviews: \u201cGlose adds his impressive voice to those of writers like Kevin Powers and Phil Klay...A collection of painfully honest and consistently empathetic glimpses of modern American soldiers in war and peace.\u201d [18]Richard B. Myers  (General, USAF, Ret. 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff): \u201cBill Glose's poetry brings the last 12 years of war in the Middle East and Central Asia into sharp focus. He elicits all the many emotions that a soldier experiences and allows us a rare glimpse into how the people fighting and those caught up in conflict see war. Everyone will learn from this work.\u201d [19]Jackie Mohan: \u201cVirginia is in good hands as Glose's well-honed expertise with language and lyricism takes the reader on a journey across the state. While some poems ruminate on nature more generally, his poems are strongest when he describes the quirks and histories of specific locations, from Tangier Island to the James River to Norfolk, such as how Norfolk got its mermaids. His poems also tell the stories of the people he encountered along his way, from notable figures of times long gone, such as Capt. John Smith, to the lives of Virginians today.\u201d  [20]Lyn C. A. Gardner: \u201cThis accomplished collection by a Hampton Roads' poet touches both the horrors and wonders of human life, providing philosophical reflections about life and relationships and taking the time to understand and empathize with both strangers and family. Starting from his own encounters but reaching far beyond them, Bill Glose succeeds admirably at the difficult task of making the poet's specific, personal experience universal.\u201d [21].",

Reprinted with permission.(buy now).\nInclude facts about their life and writing style use relevant information from the following: William Smith Monroe  ( / m \u0259 n \u02c8 r o\u028a / ; September 13, 1911 [1]  \u2013 September 9, 1996) [2]  was an American  mandolinist , singer, and songwriter, who created the  bluegrass music  genre. Because of this, he is often called the \" Father of Bluegrass \". [3]The genre takes its name from his band, the  Blue Grass Boys , who named their group for the  bluegrass  of Monroe's home state of  Kentucky . He described the genre as \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\" [4]Monroe was born on  his family's farm  near  Rosine, Kentucky , the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \"Buck\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother,  James Pendleton \"Pen\" Vandiver , were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home. [1]Bill was of  Scottish  and  English  heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and  Charlie  already played the  fiddle  and  guitar , Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable  mandolin . [1]  He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly. [ citation needed ]Monroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later. [1]  Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, \"Uncle Pen\", recorded in 1950, [1]  and the 1972 album  Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.  On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe \"a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones.\" [5]Also significant in Monroe's musical life was  Arnold Shultz , an influential  fiddler  and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the  blues . [6] [7]In 1929, Monroe moved to  Indiana  to work at an oil refinery with his brothers  Birch  and Charlie. [1]  Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the \"Monroe Brothers\", to play at local dances and house parties.Birch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in  Shenandoah, Iowa ,  Nebraska ,  South Carolina  and  North Carolina  from 1934 to 1936. [1]   RCA Victor  signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936. [1]  They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song \"What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?\" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's  Bluebird  label between 1936 and 1938. [8]After the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in  Little Rock, Arkansas , but the group only lasted for three months. [1]  Monroe then left Little Rock for  Atlanta, Georgia , to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys, [1]  with singer/guitarist  Cleo Davis , fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist  Amos Garren .In October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the  Grand Ole Opry , impressing Opry founder  George D. Hay  with his energetic performance of  Jimmie Rodgers 's \" Mule Skinner Blues \". [1]  Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist  Clyde Moody , fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks. [9]While the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for  Columbia Records  featured an  accordion , soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added  banjo  player  David \"Stringbean\" Akeman  to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942. [1]  Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the  string-band tradition  from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.Key developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of  Lester Flatt  and  Earl Scruggs  to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945. [1]  Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler  Chubby Wise  and bassist  Howard Watts , who often performed under the name \"Cedric Rainwater\".In retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the \"Original Bluegrass Band\", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or \"breaks\" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model \"Lloyd Loar\" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career. [10]The 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including \"Toy Heart\", \"Blue Grass Breakdown\", \" Molly and Tenbrooks \", \"Wicked Path of Sin\", \"My Rose of Old Kentucky\", \"Little Cabin Home on the Hill\", and Monroe's most famous song \" Blue Moon of Kentucky \", [1]  which was recorded by  Elvis Presley  in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for  Sun Records . Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's  rock and roll  cover of the song, originally a slow  ballad  in  waltz  time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit. [1]  Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the \"Blue Grass Quartet\", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar \u2013 Monroe's usual practice when performing \"sacred\" songs.Both Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the  Foggy Mountain Boys . In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the \"golden age\" of his career [11]  with what many consider the classic \"high lonesome\" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of  Jimmy Martin , the banjo of  Rudy Lyle  (replacing  Don Reno ), and fiddlers such as Merle \"Red\" Taylor,  Charlie Cline ,  Bobby Hicks , and  Vassar Clements .This band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including \"My Little Georgia Rose\", \"On and On\", \"Memories of Mother and Dad\", and \"Uncle Pen\", as well as instrumentals such as \"Roanoke\", \"Big Mon\", \"Stoney Lonesome\", \"Get Up John\", and the mandolin feature \"Raw Hide\".  Carter Stanley  joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when  The Stanley Brothers  had temporarily disbanded.On January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck. [1]  He and \"Bluegrass Boys\" bass player,  Bessie Lee Mauldin , were returning home from a fox hunt north of  Nashville . On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring. [1]  In the meantime  Charlie Cline  and  Jimmy Martin  kept the band together. [12]By the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip. [1]  The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the \" Nashville sound \" in mainstream  country music  both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the  American folk music revival  of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.The word \"bluegrass\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers,  Reno and Smiley ,  Jim and Jesse , and the  Osborne Brothers . While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of  Ralph Rinzler , a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit. [1]  Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine  Sing Out!  that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \"father\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at  Roanoke, Virginia  in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure. [1]In 1964, before the  Grateful Dead  got together,  Jerry Garcia  caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe. [13]The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player  Bill Keith  and singer/guitarist  Peter Rowan  from Massachusetts, [1]  fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist  Roland White  and fiddler  Richard Greene  from California.Even after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.In 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at  Bean Blossom  in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951, [1]  which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual  Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival  is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival. [14]Monroe's compositions during his later period were largely instrumentals, including \"Jerusalem Ridge\", \"Old Dangerfield\" (originally spelled Daingerfield after  the town in East Texas ), [15]  and \"My Last Days on Earth\"; he settled into a new role as a musical patriarch who continued to influence younger generations of musicians. Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as  Emmylou Harris ,  Waylon Jennings , and  The Oak Ridge Boys , while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians. [1]  A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry. [1]  Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule. [1]  On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for  Farm Aid IV  in  Indianapolis , Indiana along with  Willie Nelson ,  John Mellencamp ,  Neil Young  and with many other artists.Monroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996. He ended his touring and playing career in April, following a stroke. Monroe died on September 9, 1996, in  Springfield, Tennessee , four days before his 85th birthday. [2] [16]According to Smithsonian Folkways, Bill Monroe impacted music in the following five ways:Bill Monroe was made an honorary  Kentucky Colonel  in 1966. [12]  He was inducted into the  Country Music Hall of Fame  in 1970, [1]  the  Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame  in 1971, [1]  and the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  (as an \"early influence\") in 1997.  Jimmie Rodgers ,  Bob Wills ,  Hank Williams Sr. , and  Johnny Cash  are the only other performers honored in all three. As the \"father of bluegrass\", he was also an inaugural inductee into the  International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor  in 1991. Monroe was a recipient of a 1982  National Heritage Fellowship  awarded by the  National Endowment for the Arts , which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. [17]  That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. In 1993, he received the  Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , and he was awarded the  National Medal of Arts  in 1995. His well-known song \" Blue Moon of Kentucky \" has been covered not only by bluegrass but also rock and country artists, most notably Elvis Presley,  Paul McCartney , and  Patsy Cline . In 2003,  CMT  had Bill Monroe ranked No. 16 on  CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music .Artists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, \"That ain't no part of nothin'.\" Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a \"musical giant\" and recognize that \"there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe.\" [18]More than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists  Clyde Moody ,  Lester Flatt , Jack Cook,  Mac Wiseman ,  Jimmy Martin ,  Carter Stanley ,  Del McCoury ,  Peter Rowan ,  Roland White , Roland Dunn and  Doug Green ; banjo players  Earl Scruggs , Bob Black,  Butch Robins ,  Buck Trent ,  Don Reno ,  Stringbean ,  Sonny Osborne , and  Bill Keith ; and fiddlers Tommy Magness,  Chubby Wise ,  Vassar Clements ,  Byron Berline ,  Kenny Baker ,  Bobby Hicks ,  Gordon Terry ,  Randall Franks  and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso  Doc Watson .Modern bluegrass singer and mandolin player  Ricky Skaggs  was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, \"I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: I think he's probably the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band.\" [19]In 1999, the portion of  Indiana State Road 135  running from  Morgantown  through to  Nashville, Indiana  was dedicated to Bill Monroe and is known as the Bill Monroe Memorial Highway.
